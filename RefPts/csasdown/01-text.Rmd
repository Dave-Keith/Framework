# Introduction

This is the third and final research document stemming from a Framework process focused on Scallop Fishing Areas (SFAs) 25, 26, and 27B. The first research document  focused on data inputs [@keyserFrameworkDevelopmentScallop2020] while the second document developed new assessment models for SFAs 25A and 26A [@keithFrameworkDevelopmentScallop2020].  The SFA 26 management unit also includes 26B (Browns Bank South) and 26C (German Bank), whereas SFA 27 includes both 27A (Georges Bank 'a') and 27B (Georges Bank 'b'), and SFA 25, known as the Eastern Scotian Shelf is split into SFA 25A, which includes 25A-Sab (Sable Bank), 25A-Mid (Middle Bank), and 25B [Banquereau, see Table 1 in @keyserFrameworkDevelopmentScallop2020].

A history of the survey and fisheries in SFAs 25, 26, and 27B can be found in @keyserFrameworkDevelopmentScallop2020. The primary fishing area within SFA 26 is SFA 26A (Browns Bank North). In SFA 25, SFA 25A-Sab (Sable Bank) has been the most consistently fished area, the Middle Bank component of this area is excluded from these analyses due to the limited fishing activity in this portion of SFA 25; hereafter SFA 25A-Sab will be referred to as SFA 25A [@keyserFrameworkDevelopmentScallop2020]. A Bayesian State-Space Delay difference model (BSSM) has been adopted for SFA 25A, while a new Spatially Explicit Stock Assessment Model (SEAM) has been adopted for SFA 26A [@keithFrameworkDevelopmentScallop2020]. In addition, to minimize prediction bias, the productivity parameters used to project biomass into future years differed between these two areas, however in both areas the projections used the same non-spatial version of the delay difference model [@keithFrameworkDevelopmentScallop2020]. In SFA 25A, for one-year ahead projections the previous year natural mortality, recruitment, and recruit growth are used and the fully-recruited growth term is set to one (i.e., the projections assume no full-recruited growth). In SFA 26A, for one-year ahead projections, the previous year natural mortality, recruitment, recruit growth, and fully-recruited growth are used (Natural mortality and Recruitment) the annual area-wide estimates are used [@keithFrameworkDevelopmentScallop2020]. The simulations used herein are based upon the productivity parameters and the non-spatial delay difference model used for these projections.

This research document focuses on the development of limit reference points (LRPs) for SFAs 25A, 26A, 26C, and 27B. Options for the LRPs are developed based on the survey biomass indices, while for the two areas with approved assessment models (SFA 25A and SFA 26A), additional LRPs are developed using the results of MSY simulations. In addition to the LRPs, candidate target removal reference ($RR_{tar}$)  and upper stock reference points (USRs) are provided from the MSY simulations.  Harvest decision rule (HDR) simulations demonstrate how these simulations techniques can be used, in conjunction with pre-defined management objectives, to inform setting candidate limit removal reference ($RR_{lim}$) and target reference points (TRPs). This document discusses the concepts of $RR_{lim}$ and $RR_{tar}$. Herein, a $RR_{lim}$ refers to an exploitation rate that should not be exceeded for the stock, whereas a $RR_{tar}$ refers to an exploitation rate that the fishery can maintain, on average, over the long-term. The $RR_{lim}$  should always be greater than the $RR_{tar}$.

In summary, the objectives of this document are:

- To propose and adopt limit reference points for SFAs 25A, 26A, 26C, and 27B; and,
- To provide guidance on upper stock reference points, target reference points, removal reference points, and harvest decision rules.

# Methods

### Reference Points

The LRPs used throughout this document were derived from estimates of the unfished biomass ($B_0$) or the biomass as maximum sustainable yield [$B_{MSY}$, @marentetteCrossJurisdictionalReviewInternational2020; @dfoScienceAdvicePrecautionary2021; @dfoScienceAdviceGuidance2023]. LPRs typically use 20% of the estimated $B_0$ ($LRP_{20}$), 30% of $B_{MSY}$ ($LRP_{30}$), or 40% of $B_{MSY}$ [$LRP_{40}$, @dfoFisheryDecisionmakingFramework2009; @dfoScienceAdvicePrecautionary2021; @dfoScienceAdviceGuidance2023]. For the USR a similar convention is used, herein two USRs are provided for guidance, 40% of $B_0$ ($USR_{40}$) or 80% of $B_{MSY}$ [$USR_{80}$, @dfoFisheryDecisionmakingFramework2009; @marentetteCrossJurisdictionalReviewInternational2020]. In addition to the biomass reference points, guidance on candidate limit ($RR_{lim}$) and target ($RR_{tar}$) removal references are provided, for the index based reference points, these are relative indices.

## Index Based Methods

Using the survey biomass index time series LRPs and USRs were developed using 1) the highest three-year geometric mean survey biomass index as a proxy for the stocks carrying capacity or unfished biomass $B_0$ and 2) the geometric mean of the time series as a proxy for the biomass at maximum sustainable yield ($B_{MSY}$). The four areas (SFA 25A, 26A, 26C, and 27B) in which survey biomass index based reference points were developed were covered by surveys which are scheduled to occur annually. For the survey biomass indices, observation error results in uncertainty around any single year biomass estimate. It is challenging to quantify the magnitude of this uncertainty for index based methods. To reduce the potential influence of this observation error, a three-year geometric mean of the most recent three-year with data is used as the indicator of stock status for survey biomass indices; this also aligns with practices done elsewhere for ascertaining stock status using survey biomass indices [c.f., @dfoMaritimesResearchVessel2024]. To align with the model methods, the first year used for the survey index based methods will be 1994 for SFA 25A, 26A, and 27B [@keyserFrameworkDevelopmentScallop2020]. For SFA 26C, a liner was added to the gear in 2008, given changes in the gear selectivity this can induce, the analyses for this area were limited to 2008 onward. In addition, these areas tended to be fished annually, making it possible to utilize the relative exploitation rate index to explore the development of both a ($RR_{lim}$) and a ($RR_{tar}$). See @keyserFrameworkDevelopmentScallop2020 for more details on the methods underlying the development of the relative exploitation rate index and survey biomass index. 

### Removal Reference 

A semi-quantitative method (GEM - Generalized Exploitation Method) that compared the change in the relative survey biomass index ($\Delta B_r$) to the relative exploitation rate ($E_r$) was used to provide guidance on a candidate $RR_{lim}$ for the index based methods. GEM assumed a linear relationship between the change in the survey index biomass and the relative exploitation rate.


\begin{align}
\Delta B_{r_i} \sim N(0,\sigma^2_{i}) \\
E(\Delta B_{r_i}) = \mu_{i} \\
\mu_{i} =  E_{r_i}\\ 
\end{align}


Where $\Delta B_r$ was the expected value of $mu$ and was assumed to be normally distributed with a variance of $\sigma^2$; $i$ represented each observation. A significantly negative slope provides evidence that the fishery has influenced the biomass in the region, and the x-intercept provided an estimate of the relative exploitation rate above which the biomass trends tended to decline.

A second method was developed to estimate a $RR_{tar}$ for the index based methods. First, the standard deviation of the survey index biomass was calculated using a five-year moving window. For years in which there was no survey data in an area, the survey biomass index was estimated as the mean of the previous and following years indices. The five-year period in which the survey biomass index had the lowest variability was selected and the median relative exploitation rate during this period was estimated. This value was provided as an index based candidate $RR_{tar}$.

## MSY Simulations

The MSY simulations are based on the observed productivity parameters from the models that were recommended to be used for the projections of the stocks for SFAs 25A and 26A [@keithFrameworkDevelopmentScallop2020]. The underlying model for the projection simulations is based on the non-spatial delay difference model used in @keithFrameworkDevelopmentScallop2020.

$$
B_{t} = e^{-m_{fr}} g_{fr,t} (B_{t-1} - C_{t-1}) + e^{-m_{r}} g_{r,t} R_{t-1}
$$

The fully-recruited biomass is $B$, natural mortality is $m$, growth is $g$, landings are $C$, the recruit biomass is $R$, and the $t$ index represents the annual time step, which goes from 1 to the number of years in the simulation.  Where applicable, fully-recruited scallops are given the subscript $fr$, while recruits have the subscript $r$. Recruit sized scallop were defined to be 75-89 mm, and fully-recruited scallop were defined as being $\ge$ 90 mm [@keyserFrameworkDevelopmentScallop2020]. In SFA 25A, the fully-recruited growth term ($g_{fr,t}$) parameter is set to one for the simulations, while in SFA 26A the recruit natural mortality ($m_{r}$) is the same as the fully-recruited natural mortality [$m_{fr}$, @keithFrameworkDevelopmentScallop2020].

### Density Dependence

It is assumed that the adult biomass includes both recruit and fully-recruited scallop, as a result of this, we are ignoring the potential contribution of scallop with a shell height of < 75 mm on recruitment. The contribution to recruitment is expected to be minor for scallop under 75 mm in size [@parsonsIntraannualLongtermPatterns1992; @mcgarveySpatialParentAgeAnalysis1993].

Evidence for density dependence in the productivity parameters was explored using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The natural mortality terms and the growth terms were compared to the adult biomass estimates from the model and were evaluated using simple linear models (e.g., the blue line with confidence interval in Figure \@ref(fig:sab-g-ssb-fig)). In addition, a qualitative visual method was also used to identify discontinuous non-linear changes in the relationship (e.g., the red dashed vertical line in Figure \@ref(fig:sab-rps-ssb-fig)). This qualitative method is referred to hereafter as the *breakpoint* method, and was used to identify biomass levels in which the productivity changed in a non-linear fashion.

The *breakpoint* and *linear* methods were also used to explore the relationship between recruitment and biomass, but because of the nature of the recruitment process two additional steps were required before these methods could be applied. Recruits in both SFA 25A and 26A were between 75 and 89 mm in size.  The results of the von Bertalanffy analyses suggests that recruit sized scallop in SFA 25A are approximately 4 years old, while in SFA 26A faster growth results in most recruit size scallop being approximately 3 years old [@keyserFrameworkDevelopmentScallop2020]. The recruits in each SFA are thus offset by 3 (SFA 26A) or 4 (SFA 25A) years to align with the biomass of mature scallop that produced them (e.g., recruits in SFA 25A in 2020 were assumed to be 4 years old, thus these scallop were 'born' in 2016, and thus were aligned with adult biomass in 2016 which produced them). 

In addition, we explored density dependence in recruitment on a 'per-capita' basis; the biomass of recruits was divided by the biomass of fully-recruited scallop to determine the biomass of recruits produced per unit biomass of fully-recruited scallop to get a recruits per spawner (RPS) metric. When RPS is log transformed and compared to biomass the relationship is a linearization of the Ricker stock-recruit relationship.



$$
R_t = \alpha A_te^{-\beta A_t}
$$

This can be linearized as,

$$
log(\frac{R_t}{A_t}) = \alpha - \beta A_t
$$

where $R_t$ is the biomass of recruits, $A_t$ is the biomass of adult scallop, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the intercept and slope of the linearized relationship. RPS is calculated as $\frac{R_t}{A_t}$, in the simulations this value is multiplied by the simulated biomass in the appropriate year to estimate the recruit biomass.

### Correlation

The strength of autocorrelation in each productivity parameter was estimated using standard autocorrelation techniques [i.e., the *acf*, *pacf*, and *ccf* functions from the *stats* package in R version 4.2.2, @rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2023]. Where there was evidence for a linear trend in the productivity parameter, the autocorrelation was tested using detrended data (using the residuals from a linear model fit to the productivity time series). There was no evidence of autocorrelation in the growth and most of natural mortality parameters and thus no auto-correlation was modeled for these parameters, the exception was a marginally significant relationship for the fully-recruited natural mortality term for lag 2 in SFA 25A.

There was auto-correlation observed in the RPS time series in both areas, along with cross-correlation between RPS and fully-recruited natural mortality, this cross-correlation may be related to the challenges these models may have in independently estimating values of both parameters [@mcdonaldExplicitIncorporationSpatial2021]. A cross-correlation analysis focused the peak correlation at time legs of less than five years between these two parameters. The RPS auto-correlation was incorporated using an auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) framework [i.e., using the *arima.sim* function from the *stats* package, and the *rmvnorm* function from the *mvtnorm* package, R version 4.2.2, @rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2023], using the first two auto-regressive components. The cross correlation was modeled using the cross-correlation and time-lag to develop a covariance matrix and simulate two correlated time series. These time series were then used within an ARIMA framework to simulate RPS and natural mortality time series to retain the characteristics of the observed RPS and natural mortality time series.

### Simulation Procedure

The simulations build of previous projection methods, with the current simulations more completely accounting for the variability and correlation between the productivity than was possible previously [e.g., @smithFrameworkAssessmentSFA2015]. More fully characterizing the productivity dynamics aligns with recommended 'best practices' for the development of reference points [@marentetteSpecificationPrecautionaryApproach2021;@marentetteCrossJurisdictionalReviewInternational2020], moreover, these techniques enable the exploration of the impact of more complex harvest strategies on the stock dynamics (see the HDR Simulations section for more details).

The results of the density dependence and correlation analyses were used to determine how the parameters would be sampled for the simulations. In cases in which there was no evidence of either density dependence or correlation the parameters estimates for each year required in the simulation were sampled from a log-normal distribution with the mean (the median was used for natural mortality as the mean resulted in the simulations having multiple years with fully-recruited natural mortality rates in excess of 90%) and standard deviation taken from the observed time series for that productivity parameter. When the *breakpoint* method was used without correlation, the above sampling procedure was followed, but the sampling occurred using the data within an appropriate breakpoint bin. For example, if a single breakpoint was identified, when the simulated biomass for a year was below the breakpoint the mean (median for $m$) and standard deviation of the productivity data below the breakpoint were used to sample from a log-normal distribution to obtain a value for that productivity parameter for that year in the simulation. Conversely, when the data were above the breakpoint the same procedure was followed using only data from above the breakpoint biomass.

The linear method was explored, this method would use the observed relationship between the productivity parameter and adult biomass using a linear model and its uncertainty to predict the productivity at a given biomass. However, the linear method was not used in these analyses because 1) the relationship was rarely linear and 2) these models could not account for the observed variability in the data and resulted in the parameter estimates having far less variability than historically observed. Robust regression techniques were explored to better account for the variability in these data, but these methods did not overcome this challenge.  

Where correlation and density dependence were both observed in the time series both of these characteristics were incorporated into the breakpoint analysis. While the time series developed using the auto-and cross correlation parameters had the appropriate correlation structure and quantified the variability in productivity appropriately, they did not account for any observed density dependence structure. In these simulations used herein, the correlated time series data were developed using the data in which the adult biomass was below the *breakpoint* as these contained the majority of the data. When the adult biomass was above the *breakpoint* the productivity estimate was calculated using a log-normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation estimated using the observed productivity data above the  *breakpoint*. For RPS this procedure was followed in both SFA 25A and SFA 26A. This procedure somewhat weakened the strength of the correlation in the final time series, but resulted in time series in which the general correlation structure and density dependence relationships of the original productivity time series were retained (see the Results section). 

<!-- Didn't need to do this.... However, when the simulation estimated a biomass above the highest observed value, the net productivity of the system was forced to be negative.  This was achieved by setting the growth terms to vary around one, the RPS was set to vary around 10% of the lowest RPS value, and the natural mortality varied around two times the highest observed natural mortality estimate, in each of these cases the standard deviation was set to 0.1 and samples were simulated using a log normal distribution. This effectively induced a carrying capacity into the population dynamics below the maximum observed biomass, while respecting the observed population dynamics when the population was at low biomass. -->

In addition, to constrain the simulations from reaching unrealistically high biomass estimates, whenever the fully-recruited biomass exceeded the maximum observed fully-recruited biomass, RPS was resampled using a log-normal distribution where the mean RPS was set to the minimum observed RPS and the standard deviation was set to 0.1.  The exploitation rate scenarios testing in both SFA 25A and SFA 26A ranged from 0 to `r max(bbn.exp.scenario)` in steps of `r bbn.exp.scenario[2]`.  There was no variability in the exploitation rate for a given scenario, e.g., the exploitation rate scenario of 0.1 removed 10% of the fully-recruited biomass in every simulated year.  The simulations were run for `r n_y` years with `r n_sims` simulations for each exploitation rate scenario. The biomass indicators and reference points were calculated using the final 25 years of data from the simulations. 

### Model Derived Indices

$B_{MSY}$ and $B_0$ were estimated from the MSY simulation results. $B_0$ was calculated as median biomass of the final `r last.yrs` years from the simulations in which the exploitation rate was set to 0.  $B_{MSY}$  was calculated as the median biomass of the final `r last.yrs` years of the simulations using the exploitation rate that resulted in the average yield from the fishery being maximized (MSY) using the final `r last.yrs` years of simulated data. The exploitation rate at $B_{MSY}$ was the long-term target exploitation rate and this can be used to inform the setting of the $RR_{tar}$.

As with the index based methods, the criteria for the proposed LRPs and suggested USRs were based on $B_0$ and $B_{MSY}$. Proposed LRPs were set at 20% of $B_0$ ($LRP_{20}$) and 30% ($LRP_{30}$) and 40% ($LRP_{40}$)  of $B_{MSY}$, while candidate USRs at 40% of $B_0$ ($USR_{40}$) and at 80% of $B_{MSY}$ ($USR_{80}$) were provided. An additional benefit of using stochastic simulations is the ability to identify the proportion of the time that the stocks are in the critical (below the LRP), cautious (between the LRP and USR), and healthy zones (above the USR). Using the final `r last.yrs` years of data and using $LRP_{20}$ and $USR_{40}$ as examples, the proportion of the time each of the simulations were in these zones when fishing at the exploitation rate that resulted in the biomass being at $B_{MSY}$.

### HDR Simulations

The stochastic simulations developed herein can be used to explore the impact of utilizing more complex harvest strategies than explored in the above MSY simulations (where the exploitation rate for a given simulation is fixed through time). For the HDR simulations, the productivity parameters are simulated as per the above procedures, but instead of using a fixed exploitation rate, it can be varied as a function of the current simulated biomass. In addition, these HDR simulations can link the exploitation rates to the reference points and explore how varying the exploitation rates at each of the reference points (often referred to as *control points*) will impact the stock dynamics over the long-term. 

While these HDR simulations are not required for setting the LRP, an exploration of these HDR simulations would provide additional understanding of the impact of implementing different USRs and $RR_{tar}$. Additionally, HDR simulations enable the exploration of additional reference points, such as the development of a biomass based target reference point (TRP) and limit removal reference ($RR_{lim}$) [@dfoFisheryDecisionmakingFramework2009; @marentetteCrossJurisdictionalReviewInternational2020]. The TRP is a value above the USR and is determined by productivity objectives or other biological considerations [@marentetteCrossJurisdictionalReviewInternational2020; @dfoScienceAdvicePrecautionary2021; @dfoScienceAdviceGuidance2023].  

There are innumerable HDRs that could be tested and an optimal strategy is dependent on the management objectives. As shown in the below demonstration of the methods, these simulation have the potential to inform alternative harvesting strategies that could have both conservation and socioeconomic benefits. The code to explore the impact of various HDRs on the stock is publicly available [@keithOffshoreScallopHarvest2025] and could be used by stakeholders and managers, with guidance from DFO Science, to explore HDRs based on a suite of characteristics (e.g., identify strategies that maintain the stock in the healthy zone > X% of the time while maintaining the long term average fishery removals to be > X tonnes). Defining *optimal* HDRs is contingent on the management objectives and as such this was outside the scope of this Framework, however, an example for each of SFA 25A and SFA 26A was provided to demonstrate the utility of this methodology.

Here, the TRP was set at the $B_{msy}$ estimate to illustrate the utility of implementing a TRP, however other candidate TRPs could be identified, such as 80% of $B_0$. For these examples, the 'management objectives' were to 1) maintain the stock near the TRP, 2) increase the long term average removals from the fishery, and 3) reduce the proportion of time the stock is below the LRP. For 2) and 3) these objectives were compared to the MSY simulations in which the exploitation rate resulted in the population being at $B_{MSY}$.  

For these simulations, when the biomass was below the LRP there was no fishing, while the target exploitation rate declined linearly as the biomass declined from the USR to the LRP. The exploitation rate in any given year of the simulation was allowed to vary following a log-normal distribution, the standard deviation was set to `r bbn.exp.sd`, while the mean was set at the target exploitation rate as described below. The results provided summarize the final `r last.yrs` years of the `r n_sims` simulated time series and, similarly to the MSY simulations, the proportion of the time the simulations are observed to be below the LRP, above the USR or TRP, or between these values was calculated.

In SFA 25A, the HDR simulation example set the exploitation rate to a) an $RR_{lim}$ of `r sab.trp.exp` above the TRP (`r sab.trp.bmsy` tonnes), b)  `r sab.usr.exp` above the USR (`r sab.usr.b0` tonnes) but below the TRP, c) decline linearly from `r sab.usr.exp` at the USR, to 0 at the LRP (`r sab.lrp.b0` tonnes) when below the USR but above the LRP , d) 0 below the LRP. Similarly, in SFA 26A, the HDR simulation example set the exploitation rate to a) an an $RR_{lim}$ of `r bbn.trp.exp`  above the TRP (`r bbn.trp.bmsy`  tonnes), b) `r bbn.usr.exp` above the USR (`r bbn.usr.b0` tonnes) and below the TRP, c) decline linearly from `r bbn.usr.exp` at the USR, to 0 at the LRP (`r bbn.lrp.b0` tonnes) when below the USR but above the LRP, d) 0 below the LRP.

# Results

## Productivity and Density Dependence

### SFA 25A

There is clear evidence for density dependence in recruitment, with RPS increasing as biomass declines (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-rps-ssb-fig)). The general relationship follows the expectation of a Ricker model (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-rps-ssb-fig)). However, there are two challenges with using the Ricker model, 1) it would tend to underestimate the observed RPS when the adult biomass was below approximately `r sab.rps.bp2` tonnes, and 2) it does not fully account for the variability in the observed data (e.g., 11 of the 25 RPS values were outside the 95% CI). Therefore, the *breakpoint* method was used. The breakpoint used was `r sab.rps.bp2` tonnes (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-rps-ssb-fig)). A second potential *breakpoint* was identified at `r sab.rps.bp1` tonnes, however simulation testing using this as a breakpoint lead to the stock consistently producing relatively large recruit biomass whenever the stock biomass was below `r sab.rps.bp1` tonnes. This resulted in the simulations using this *breakpoint* supporting exploitation rates that were two to three times higher than has ever been observed in SFA 25A, as a result this additional breakpoint was not incorporated into the simulations. There was little evidence for density dependence in the growth or natural mortality parameters (Figures \@ref(fig:sab-g-ssb-fig) and \@ref(fig:sab-m-ssb-fig)). There was also no obvious discontinuous breaks in the relationships between growth or natural mortality as adult biomass increased (Figures \@ref(fig:sab-g-ssb-fig) and \@ref(fig:sab-m-ssb-fig)). Therefore, no density dependence was incorporated into the simulations for the growth or natural mortality parameters in the simulations.

There is evidence of autocorrelation in the RPS time series, with a significant positive correlation (`r sab.rps.cor.1`) at a one year lag (Figure  \@ref(fig:sab-pacf-rps-fig)). There was no evidence of correlation in the growth parameters (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-pacf-g-fig)). A weakly significant negative correlation (`r sab.m.cor.2`) was observed at a two year lag for the fully-recruited mortality and this was incorporated into the simulations, while there was no correlation in the recruit mortality time series (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-pacf-m-fig)). Finally, the cross-correlation between RPS (offset to the year the recruits are observed in the time series) and fully-recruited natural mortality was evaluated, a weak but significant correlation was observed in the relationship, the highest correlations were observed between lags of -1 to 1 years, with the peak at `r sab.m.rps.lag` (r = `r sab.m.rps.cor`, Figure \@ref(fig:sab-ccf-m-rps-fig)). This suggests that relatively large (small) recruit biomass events (given the adult biomass that produced the recruits) were observed during periods of high (low) natural mortality. To account for this effect, the simulations included the correlation between fully-recruited natural mortality and RPS at the peak lag.

The annual survey biomass index estimates (q-corrected) were highly correlated to the model biomass estimates, although there are several years in which the survey biomass index was noticeably different than the resultant model biomass estimate (e.g., 1995, 2010, and 2022) and most of the data fall near the 1:1 line (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-bm-vs-index-fig)). This indicated that the survey biomass index is generally a good proxy for the model biomass, but the two metrics will differ when comparing individual years (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-bm-vs-index-fig)).

### SFA 26A

There is clear evidence for density dependence in recruitment, with RPS increasing as biomass declines (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-rps-ssb-fig)). The general relationship follows the expectation of a Ricker model (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-rps-ssb-fig)). However, there are two challenges with using the Ricker model, 1) the highest RPS value tended to occur at intermediate adult biomass but these values were offset by years with moderate RPS values, these high values could not be captured by a linear model and 2) more generally the model is unable to fully account for the variability in the observed data (e.g., 17 of the 25 RPS values were outside the 95% CI). Therefore, the *breakpoint* method was used. A single breakpoint was identified, when the adult biomass was above `r bbn.rps.bp` tonnes RPS tended to be the lowest observed in the time series, while there was no evidence for a trend in RPS with changes in adult biomass below this value (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-rps-ssb-fig)). There was little evidence for density dependence in the growth or natural mortality parameters (Figures \@ref(fig:bbn-g-ssb-fig) and \@ref(fig:bbn-m-ssb-fig)). There was also no obvious discontinuous breaks in the relationships between growth and adult biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-g-ssb-fig)), although we note that low values of natural mortality were not observed when the adult biomass was above approximately `r bbn.m.bp` tonnes (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-m-ssb-fig)). As a result, no density dependence was incorporated into the simulations for growth or natural mortality in the simulations.

There is evidence of autocorrelation in the RPS time series, with a significant positive correlation (`r bbn.rps.cor.1`) at a one year lag and a significant negative correlation at a two year lag (`r bbn.rps.cor.2`, Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-pacf-rps-fig)). There was no significant correlation in the growth or natural mortality time series (Figures \@ref(fig:bbn-pacf-g-fig) and \@ref(fig:bbn-pacf-m-fig)). Finally, the cross-correlation between RPS (offset to the year the recruits are observed in the time series) and fully-recruited natural mortality was evaluated, a significant correlation was observed in the relationship, the highest correlations were observed between lags of 0 to 2 years, with the peak at a lag of `r bbn.m.rps.lag` year (r = `r bbn.m.rps.cor`, Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-ccf-m-rps-fig)). This suggests that relatively large (small) recruit biomass events (given the adult biomass that produced the recruits) were observed during periods of high (low) natural mortality. To account for this effect, the simulations included the correlation between fully-recruited natural mortality and RPS at the peak lag.

The annual survey biomass index estimates (q-corrected using the median estimated q from the model) were highly correlated to the model biomass estimates, although the survey biomass index does not follow the model biomass estimates as closely as observed in SFA 25A (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-bm-vs-index-fig)). In several of the early years in the time series (i.e., 1994-1998), the model biomass estimate is notably higher than the survey biomass index, this may be related to the initial conditions required for SEAM  [@keithFrameworkDevelopmentScallop2020]. In general, these results indicated that the survey biomass index is a reasonable proxy for the model biomass, especially in more recent years, but that differences between the two metrics in a particular year can be substantial (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-bm-vs-index-fig)).

## Reference Points

### Survey Biomass Indices

Three survey biomass index based LRPs were proposed in each area (Table \@ref(tab:survey-index-rp-table)).  In SFA 25A, $LRP_{30}$ was `r LRP.med.3.25a` tonnes, $LRP_{40}$ was `r LRP.med.4.25a` tonnes and $LRP_{20}$ was `r LRP.max.2.25a` tonnes, while the most recent three-year average biomass index estimate for SFA 25A was `r bm.last.3.25a`  (Figure \@ref(fig:rp-bmi-fit)). In SFA 26A, t$LRP_{30}$ was `r LRP.med.3.26a` tonnes, $LRP_{40}$ was `r LRP.med.4.26a` tonnes and $LRP_{20}$ was `r LRP.max.2.26a` tonnes, while the most recent three-year average biomass index estimate for SFA 26A was `r bm.last.3.26a` (Figure \@ref(fig:rp-bmi-fit)). In SFA 26C, the $LRP_{30}$ was `r LRP.med.3.26c` tonnes, $LRP_{40}$ was `r LRP.med.4.26c` tonnes and $LRP_{20}$ was `r LRP.max.2.26c` tonnes, while the most recent three-year average biomass index estimate for SFA 26C was `r bm.last.3.26c` (Figure \@ref(fig:rp-bmi-fit)). In SFA 27B, the $LRP_{30}$ was `r LRP.med.3.27b` tonnes, $LRP_{40}$ was `r LRP.med.4.27b` tonnes and $LRP_{20}$ was `r LRP.max.2.27b` tonnes, while the most recent three-year average biomass index estimate for SFA 27B was `r bm.last.3.27b` (Figure \@ref(fig:rp-bmi-fit)). 

Two survey biomass index based candidate USRs were developed in each area (Table \@ref(tab:survey-index-rp-table)). In SFA 25A, $USR_{80}$ was `r USR.med.8.25a` tonnes, while the $USR_{40}$ was `r USR.max.4.25a` tonnes (Figure \@ref(fig:rp-bmi-fit)). In SFA 26A,  $USR_{80}$ was `r USR.med.8.26a` tonnes, while  $USR_{40}$ was `r USR.max.4.26a` tonnes  (Figure \@ref(fig:rp-bmi-fit)). In SFA 26C,  $USR_{80}$ was `r USR.med.8.26c` tonnes, while  $USR_{40}$ was `r USR.max.4.26c` tonnes  (Figure \@ref(fig:rp-bmi-fit). In SFA 27B, the  $USR_{80}$ was `r USR.med.8.27b` tonnes, while  $USR_{40}$ was `r USR.max.4.27b` tonnes  (Figure \@ref(fig:rp-bmi-fit)).

The phase plots using the relative removal and survey biomass indices indicated that the relative exploitation rate did not have a clear relationship to the survey biomass index in any of the areas (Figure \@ref(fig:kobe-bmi-fig)). GEM was unable to identify a relationship between the change in biomass indices and relative exploitation rate in SFA 25A, 26C, or 27B that would facilitate the development of a $RR_{lim}$ in these areas (Figure \@ref(fig:gem-bmi-fig)). In SFA 26A, the change in the biomass index tended to decline as the relative exploitation rate increased which facilitated the development of a candidate $RR_{lim}$ using the relative indices, the GEM suggested a candidate $RR_{lim}$ of approximately `r rr.rf.26a` (top right panel, Figure \@ref(fig:gem-bmi-fig) and Table \@ref(tab:survey-index-rp-table)).

A candidate $RR_{tar}$ was identified in each of the areas based on the five-year period with the least variability in the survey biomass index (Table \@ref(tab:survey-index-rp-table)). In SFA 25A, the least variability in the survey biomass index occurred between `r min(low.25a.yrs)` and `r max(low.25a.yrs)`, using this method the candidate $RR_{tar}$ was `r target.rr.25a.index`. In SFA 26A, the least variability in the survey biomass index occurred between  `r min(low.26a.yrs)` and `r max(low.26a.yrs)`, using this method the candidate $RR_{tar}$ was `r target.rr.26a.index`. In SFA 26C, the least variability in the survey biomass index occurred between `r min(low.26c.yrs)` and `r max(low.26c.yrs)`, using this method the candidate $RR_{tar}$ was `r target.rr.26c.index`. In SFA 27B, the least variability in the survey biomass index occurred between `r min(low.27b.yrs)` and `r max(low.27b.yrs)`, using this method the candidate $RR_{tar}$ was `r target.rr.27b.index`.

### MSY Simulations

In SFA 25A the MSY simulation time series of the productivity parameters had similar characteristics to the productivity data, the comparison of the simulated time series' to the observed productivity data was done using the results from the simulations in which the exploitation rate was set to `r sab.rr`. The recruit growth and natural mortality parameters from the simulations had minimal auto-correlation (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-sim-acfs-fig)). The simulated RPS time series retained the lag 1 correlation without any notable lag 2 correlation (mean simulation estimates were `r sab.cor.sim.summary$rps.ar1` and `r sab.cor.sim.summary$rps.ar2` respectively, Figure \@ref(fig:sab-sim-acfs-fig)). The fully-recruited natural mortality retained the lag 2 correlation without any notable lag 1 correlation (mean simulation estimate were `r sab.cor.sim.summary$m.acf.ar2` and `r sab.cor.sim.summary$m.acf.ar1` respectively, Figure \@ref(fig:sab-sim-acfs-fig)).  In addition, the peak correlation between natural mortality and RPS is also present in the simulated data at lag 1, however as with the RPS and natural mortality auto-correlation, this value is somewhat lower in the simulations (the mean simulation estimate was `r sab.cor.sim.summary$rps.m.cor`, Figure \@ref(fig:sab-sim-ccf-fig)). The density dependence observed in the RPS data was retained in the simulations, with recruitment being consistently low when the adult biomass exceeded the *breakpoint* (`r sab.rps.bp2` tonnes) and the RPS values below the *breakpoint* were similar to the underlying observed RPS values, no density dependence was observed in the other simulated productivity parameters (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-sim-dd-fig)).

In SFA 25A, the MSY simulation results indicated that the median biomass stabilizes at approximately `r sab.b0` when the exploitation rate is 0, this is hereafter considered the *unfished biomass* ($B_0$) for SFA 25A (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-mn-bm-sim-fig)). The exploitation rate that maximized the removals in the long term was `r sab.rr` (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-mn-fmsy-sim-fig)), this is a candidate $RR_{tar}$ for SFA 25A based on the historically observed productivity regime. The median biomass at the $RR_{tar}$ was `r sab.bmsy` tonnes and this was considered the biomass at maximum sustainable yield ($B_{msy}$, Figure \@ref(fig:sab-mn-bmsy-sim-fig)). The median annual removals at $B_{msy}$ were `r sab.c.at.msy` tonnes (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-mn-fmsy-sim-fig)).

Based on these values three MSY simulation based LRPs are proposed for SFA 25A, the $LRP_{30}$ was `r sab.lrp.3.bmsy` tonnes, $LRP_{40}$ was `r sab.lrp.4.bmsy` tonnes, and $LRP_{20}$ was `r sab.lrp.b0` tonnes (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-mod-rps-fig) and Table \@ref(tab:model-rp-table)). Two MSY simulation candidate USRs are provided for SFA 25A, $USR_{80}$ was `r sab.usr.bmsy` tonnes and $USR_{40}$ was `r sab.usr.b0` tonnes (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-mod-rps-fig) and Table \@ref(tab:model-rp-table)). Using the MSY simulation  based $LRP_{20}$ and $USR_40$ reference points as examples, and the candidate $RR_{tar}$ of `r sab.rr`, the simulations for SFA 25A resulted in the population being above the USR (i.e., in the "Healthy Zone") `r sab.prop.yrs.healthy`% of the time, below the LRP (i.e., in the "Critical Zone") `r sab.prop.yrs.critical`% of the time, and between the LRP and USR (i.e., in the "Cautious Zone") `r sab.prop.yrs.cautious`% of the time (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-mod-reals-rps-fig)).

In SFA 26A the MSY simulation time series of the productivity parameters retained similar characteristics to the productivity data, the comparison of the simulated time series' to the observed productivity data was done using the results from the simulations in which the exploitation rate was set to `r bbn.rr`. The growth and natural mortality parameters from the simulations have minimal auto-correlation (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-sim-acfs-fig)). The simulated RPS time series retains both a lag 1 and lag 2 correlation (mean simulation estimates were `r bbn.cor.sim.summary$rps.ar1` and `r bbn.cor.sim.summary$rps.ar2` respectively; this correlation is somewhat weaker than the observed RPS time series, Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-sim-acfs-fig)).  In addition, the peak correlation between natural mortality and RPS is also present in the simulated data at lag -1, however as with the RPS and natural mortality auto-correlation, this value is somewhat lower in the simulations (the mean simulation estimate was `r bbn.cor.sim.summary$rps.m.cor`, Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-sim-ccf-fig)).  The density dependence of RPS is retained, with it being consistently low when the adult biomass exceeded the *breakpoint* (`r bbn.rps.bp` tonnes) and the value of RPS below the breakpoint being similar to the underlying observed RPS values, no density dependence was observed in the other simulated productivity parameters (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-sim-dd-fig)).

In SFA 26A, the MSY simulation results indicated that the median biomass stabilizes at approximately `r bbn.b0` when the exploitation rate is 0, this is hereafter considered the *unfished biomass* ($B_0$) for SFA 26A (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-mn-bm-sim-fig)). The exploitation rate that maximized the removals in the long term was `r bbn.rr` (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-mn-fmsy-sim-fig)), this is a candidate $RR_{tar}$ for SFA 26A based on the historically observed productivity regime.  The median biomass at the $RR_{tar}$ was `r bbn.bmsy` tonnes and this was considered the biomass as maximum sustainable yield ($B_{msy}$, Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-mn-bmsy-sim-fig)). The median annual removals at $B_{msy}$ were `r bbn.c.at.msy` tonnes (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-mn-fmsy-sim-fig)).

Based on these values three MSY simulation based LRPs are proposed for SFA 26A, $LRP_{30}$ was `r bbn.lrp.3.bmsy` tonnes, $LRP_{40}$ was `r bbn.lrp.4.bmsy` tonnes, and $LRP_{20}$ was `r bbn.lrp.b0` tonnes. (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-mod-rps-fig) and Table \@ref(tab:model-rp-table)). Two MSY simulation candidate USRs are provided for SFA 26A, $USR_{80}$ was `r bbn.usr.bmsy` tonnes and $USR_{40}$ was `r bbn.usr.b0` tonnes (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-mod-rps-fig) and Table \@ref(tab:model-rp-table)). Using the MSY simulation based $LRP_{20}$ and $USR_40$ reference points as examples, and the candidate $RR_{tar}$ of `r bbn.rr`, the simulations for SFA 26A resulted in the population being above the USR (i.e., in the "Healthy Zone") `r bbn.prop.yrs.healthy`% of the time, below the LRP (i.e., in the "Critical Zone") `r bbn.prop.yrs.critical`% of the time, and between the LRP and USR (i.e., in the "Cautious Zone") `r bbn.prop.yrs.cautious`% of the time (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-mod-reals-rps-fig)).

## HDR Simulations

While MSY simulation based candidate $RR_{tar}$ estimates have been proposed for SFA 25A and SFA 26A, this does not preclude more nuanced HDRs being developed for these areas. For SFA 25A, the results of the HDR simulations indicated that the median biomass (`r sab.med.bm.hcr` tonnes) fluctuated around the TRP (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-mn-bm-hcr-fig)).  The average removals were `r sab.mn.catch.hcr` tonnes, while the median removals were `r sab.med.catch.hcr` tonnes (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-mn-c-hcr-fig)). The stock was below the LRP `r sab.prop.yrs.bl.lrp.hcr`% of the time, it was in the cautious zone `r sab.prop.yrs.cautious.hcr`% of the time, it was between the USR and the TRP `r sab.prop.yrs.healthy.hcr`% of the time, and was above the TRP `r sab.prop.yrs.above.trp.hcr`% of the time (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-real-bm-hcr-fig)). This results in a bifurcation of the landings, for example, while the stock is above the USR but below the TRP (which happens `r sab.prop.yrs.healthy.hcr`% of the time), landings generally ranged from `r sab.min.healthy.zone.catch.hcr` to `r sab.max.healthy.zone.catch.hcr` tonnes, while above the TRP the landings were usually greater than `r sab.min.trp.catch.hcr` tonnes, and occasionally were more than double this (Figure \@ref(fig:sab-real-c-hcr-fig)).

For the SFA 26A, the results of the HDR simulations indicated that the median biomass (`r bbn.med.bm.hcr` tonnes) fluctuated around the TRP (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-mn-bm-hcr-fig)). The mean removals were `r bbn.mn.catch.hcr` tonnes, while the median removals were `r bbn.med.catch.hcr` tonnes (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-mn-c-hcr-fig)). The stock was below the LRP `r bbn.prop.yrs.bl.lrp.hcr`% of the time, it was in the cautious zone `r bbn.prop.yrs.cautious.hcr`% of the time, it was between the USR and the TRP `r bbn.prop.yrs.healthy.hcr`% of the time, and was above the TRP `r bbn.prop.yrs.above.trp.hcr`% of the time (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-real-bm-hcr-fig)). This results in a bifurcation of the landings, for example, while the stock is above the USR but below the TRP (which happens `r bbn.prop.yrs.healthy.hcr`% of the time), landings generally ranged from `r bbn.min.healthy.zone.catch.hcr` to `r bbn.max.healthy.zone.catch.hcr` tonnes, while above the TRP the landings were usually greater than `r bbn.min.trp.catch.hcr` tonnes, and occasionally were more than double this (Figure \@ref(fig:bbn-real-c-hcr-fig)).

# Conclusions

For SFA 25A, three survey index based LRPs were proposed, `r LRP.max.2.25a` tonnes (20% of $B_0$, $LRP_{20}$), `r LRP.med.3.25a` tonnes (30% of $B_{MSY}$, $LRP_{30}$), and `r LRP.med.4.25a` tonnes (40% of $B_{MSY}$, $LRP_{40}$). Using the survey index based methods in SFA 25A, guidance for two USRs were provided, `r USR.max.4.25a` tonnes (40% of $B_0$, $USR_{40}$) and `r USR.med.8.25a` tonnes (80% of $B_{MSY}$, $USR_{80}$). There was no relationship observed between biomass change and the relative exploitation rate, and thus the GEM method was unable to provide guidance for a $RR_{lim}$. A candidate $RR_{tar}$ value of `r target.rr.25a.index` was identified using the median relative exploitation rate during the five-year period with the least biomass variability observed in the survey biomass index.

The MSY simulations were used to identify three candidate model based LRPs for SFA 25A, `r sab.lrp.b0` tonnes (20% of $B_0$, $LRP_{20}$),  `r sab.lrp.3.bmsy` tonnes (30% of $B_{MSY}$, $LRP_{30}$), and `r sab.lrp.4.bmsy` tonnes (40% of $B_{MSY}$, $LRP_{40}$). These simulations were also used to identify two candidate model based USRs,  `r sab.usr.b0` tonnes (40% of $B_0$, $USR{40}$) and `r sab.usr.bmsy` tonnes (80% of $B_{MSY}$, $USR_{80}$), along with a candidate $RR_{tar}$ of `r sab.rr`. 

For SFA 26A, three survey index based LRPs were proposed, `r LRP.max.2.26a` tonnes (20% of $B_0$, $LRP_{20}$),  `r LRP.med.3.26a` tonnes (30% of $B_{MSY}$, $LRP_{30}$), and `r LRP.med.4.26a` tonnes (40% of $B_{MSY}$, $LRP_{40}$). Using the survey index based methods in SFA 25A, guidance for two USRs were provided, `r USR.max.4.26a` tonnes (40% of $B_0$, $USR_{40}$) and `r USR.med.8.26a` tonnes (80% of $B_{MSY}$, $USR_{80}$). The GEM was able to identify a candidate $RR_{lim}$ of `r rr.rf.26a`. In addition, a $RR_{tar}$ value of `r target.rr.26a.index` was identified using the median relative exploitation rate during the five-year period with the least biomass variability observed in the survey biomass index.

The MSY simulations were used to identify three candidate model based LRPs for SFA 26A, `r bbn.lrp.b0` tonnes (20% of $B_0$),  `r bbn.lrp.3.bmsy` tonnes (30% of $B_{MSY}$), and `r bbn.lrp.4.bmsy` tonnes (40% of $B_{MSY}$, $LRP_{40}$). These simulations were also used to identify two candidate model based USRs,  `r bbn.usr.b0` tonnes (40% of $B_0$, $USR_{40}$) and `r bbn.usr.bmsy` tonnes (80% of $B_{MSY}$, $USR_{80}$), along with a candidate $RR_{tar}$ of `r bbn.rr`. 

For SFA 26C, three survey index based LRPs were proposed, `r LRP.max.2.26c` tonnes (20% of $B_0$, $LRP_{20}$), `r LRP.med.3.26c` tonnes (30% of $B_{MSY}$, $LRP_{30}$), and `r LRP.med.4.26c` tonnes (40% of $B_{MSY}$, $LRP_{40}$). Using the survey index based methods in SFA 26C, guidance for two USRs were provided, `r USR.max.4.26c` tonnes (40% of $B_0$, $USR_{40}$) and `r USR.med.8.26c` tonnes (80% of $B_{MSY}$, $USR_{80}$). There was no relationship observed between biomass change and the relative exploitation rate, and thus the GEM method was unable to provide guidance for a $RR_{lim}$. A candidate $RR_{tar}$ value of `r target.rr.26c.index` was identified using the median relative exploitation rate during the five-year period with the least biomass variability observed in the survey biomass index.

For SFA 27B, three survey index based LRPs were proposed, `r LRP.max.2.27b` tonnes (20% of $B_0$, $LRP_{20}$), `r LRP.med.3.27b` tonnes (30% of $B_{MSY}$, $LRP_{30}$), and `r LRP.med.4.27b` tonnes (40% of $B_{MSY}$, $LRP_{40}$). Using the survey index based methods in SFA 27B, guidance for two USRs were provided, `r USR.max.4.27b` tonnes (40% of $B_0$, $USR_{40}$) and `r USR.med.8.27b` tonnes (80% of $B_{MSY}$, $USR_{80}$). There was no relationship observed between biomass change and the relative exploitation rate, and thus the GEM method was unable to provide guidance for a $RR_{lim}$. A candidate $RR_{tar}$ value of `r target.rr.27b.index` was identified using the median relative exploitation rate during the five-year period with the least biomass variability observed in the survey biomass index.

In case the model biomass estimates are unavailable, the utility of using the survey biomass indices as a proxy for the stock status was also explored for the two modelled areas. In SFA 25A, the q-corrected survey biomass index is highly correlated to the model biomass estimate and therefore this provides similar information as the model biomass. In SFA 26A, while the q-corrected survey index is somewhat correlated to the model biomass estimate, the differences between the two metrics can be substantial and caution is recommended if attempting to use this index as a proxy for the modelled stock status.

The HDR simulations were used to identify how these methods can be used to identify candidate $RR_{lim}$ and TRPs for the modelled areas. In both areas, the probability of the stock declining below the LRP was lower using the example HDR strategy, while the resultant long-term average harvest levels increased substantially when compared to using a static HDR. This alternative strategy accomplished this by reducing the exploitation rate in the "Healthy Zone" below the exploitation rate at $B_{msy}$ (which is commonly used as either the $RR_{lim}$ or $RR_{tar}$), while allowing for removals to exceed the exploitation rate at $B_{msy}$ when the biomass was above the TRP.  Within the context of the DFO precautionary approach the $RR_{lim}$ identified in these HDR simulations could serve as the maximum allowable exploitation rate which would only be applicable when the stock is above its TRP [@dfoScienceAdvicePrecautionary2021; @dfoScienceAdviceGuidance2023]. From the perspective of the fishery, the example HDRs lead to much higher inter-annual variability in the removals, with relatively large fishing removals occurring approximately 50% of the time, in addition this would result in relatively low removals in the near term as the biomass in both areas increases towards the TRP. However, the maximum removals that would be recommended when the stocks are above the USR but below the TRP are higher than the recently observed removals in SFA 25A, and are not substantially different from the level of removals observed in SFA 26A in recent years (this also provides additional justification for these HDRs as they broadly align with recently observed management practices in these areas). Finally, more complex HDRs could also be explored, such as allowing the  $RR_{lim}$ to be a function of the biomass whenever the biomass is above a TRP. 

Information which can be used to inform the development of USRs, TRPs, and RRs has been provided for each of the four areas. While it is outside the purview of DFO Science to set these values, additional guidance for their development is provided. It is not recommended to implement both USRs and TRPs for the survey index based RPs, the benefit of the TRP occurs when an additional HDR can be set around the TRP. However, there is insufficient information in the data to provide guidance on an appropriate HDR in the index based RP areas. However, if it is deemed necessary to set a TRP for the areas with index based RPs, it is suggested to use the $B_{msy}$ proxy, or 80% of the $B_{0}$ proxy for the TRP without an additional HDR. For the modelled areas, additional exploration of potential HDR strategies is recommended, however to undertake this exercise in an efficient manner, the development of quantifiable management objectives for the fishery is recommended.

The models in SFA 25A and 26A should be subject to re-evaluation to ensure they are capturing the population dynamics of the areas, and to monitor for changes in the productivity. It is challenging to predict when the models should next be re-evaluated as this is a function of ecological, social, and economic factors which cannot be forecast. It is recommended that the process error component of the models is monitored; a long-term directional bias in the process error would indicate a shift in the productivity of the stock that is not being accounted for by the model productivity parameters. This would indicate the need for additional research to understand the processes driving the changes and would enable the development of models that attempt to account for the changes in productivity. Such a productivity shift would also impact the reference points for the area and would require additional simulation testing once new models had been developed.

The methods used here relied on fishery-independent metrics. While reference points can be developed using fishery-dependent data, fishery-dependent methods would not be appropriate for these areas because of the rapid increase in fishery efficiency over the last two decades and the adoption of larger more powerful vessels over the last 30 years [@keithEvaluatingSocioeconomicConservation2020; @keyserFrameworkDevelopmentScallop2020].  Fishery dependent methods generally rely on using some measure of catch per unit effort (CPUE), the underlying assumption of these methods is that CPUE is proportional to the biomass of the population [@hilbornQuantitativeFisheriesStock1992]. Unfortunately when changes in fishing efficiency are driven by technological change CPUE is not proportional to the population biomass, and this limits the applicability of these methods for these types of analyses.


<!-- and to monitor the survey biomass index annually to provide guidance on stock status and setting TACs. This course of action is recommend because of the strong correlation between the survey biomass index and the model results, the limited removals from the area, and the lack of a clear relationship between the exploitation rate and changes in the biomass in SFA 25A.  The could be achieved using a four-step process, 1) use the three-year geometric mean survey biomass index and the index based reference points to determine the stock status, 2) once developed, use the model based HDRs to determine the appropriate exploitation rate given stock status, 3) Divide the three-year geometric mean survey biomass index by the model catchability (`r sab.q`) to get an estimate of the total biomass, 4) multiply this q-corrected survey biomass by the exploitation rate to provide a TAC recommendation. If the three-year geometric mean survey biomass index falls below the LRP there would be no removals in the upcoming year and this would trigger a request for DFO Science to re-run the SFA 25A model and provide updated results. -->

<!-- For SFA 26A, it is recommended to continue with annual updates using a model based LRP, the recommended LRP for this are is `r bbn.lrp.b0` tonnes (20% of $B_0$). We also recommend incorporating a secondary index based LRP and USR for this area. The development of these secondary reference points has two primary benefits, 1) it can help provide guidance during the setting of interim TAC's before the model is run, 2) it can be used in lieu of the model results if there are challenges with running the model in a given year. If a secondary index based LRP is adopted we recommend it to be `r LRP.med.3.26a` tonnes (30% of $B_{msy}$). This value was chosen because the ratio of this LRP to the biomass index is more similar to the same ratio using the model LRP and biomass estimates than the other index based LRPs. As suggested in other areas, the index based RPs should be compared the geometric mean biomass for the last three-years with data. -->

<!-- For SFA 26C, it is recommended to use the index based LRP of `r LRP.max.2.26c` tonnes (20% of $B_0$). The LRP should be compared to the geometric mean biomass for the last three-years with data. The available data do not contain a great deal of information to help inform the setting of an index based Removal Reference Point, however, we do suggest the relative exploitation rate should not exceed the maximum observed relative exploitation rate in the area -->

<!-- For SFA 27B, it is recommended to use the index based LRP of `r LRP.max.2.27b` tonnes (20% of $B_0$). The LRP should be compared to the geometric mean biomass for the last three-years with data. The available data do not contain a great deal of information to help inform setting an index based Removal Reference Point, however, we do suggest the relative exploitation rate should not exceed the maximum observed relative exploitation rate in the area. While it was not directly addressed within this Framework, the utility of incorporating SFA 27B into the next iteration of models developed within SFA 27 should be a research priority ahead of the next Framework for SFA 27. -->
