  This research document focuses on the development of new stock assessment methodologies for the stocks in Scallop Fishing Area (SFA) 25a and SFA 26a. A Bayesian State-Space Delay difference model (BSSM) has been used to assess the status of SFA 26a for over a decade, but no analytical models have ever been developed for SFA 25a. A modified version of the BSSM currently used for the SFA 26a asessments has been developed for these two stocks. Advances in computing power and the availability of new statistical methods has enabled the development of a Spatially Explicit Assessment Model (SEAM) that is also based on the same conceptual delay-difference modelling framework. The results for both types of model will be shown for comparative purposes, while model diagnostics such as retrospective analyses and visualization of residual patterns will be shown for the SEAM models. Overall the two modelling frameworks provide broadly similar results, but there are differences in the productivity parameters between the models; these differences are more notable in SFA 25a.  The exploitation rate in SFA 25a has been low throughout the timeframe covered by the model and the fishery appears to have had little impact on the stock dynamics in SFA 25a.  In SFA 26a, there is evidence that the fishery does impact the stock dynamics, for this stock the fully-recruited biomass has always declined when the exploitation rate exceeds approximately 8%. For both stocks, the retrospective patterns for the SEAM models indicate that fully-recruited biomass estimates are not strongly influenced by the addition of additional years of data, while the natural mortality and recruit biomasses are more variable as new data are included in the model. The analyses of the random fields, process error, and residuals, all indicate that the process component of SEAM would tend to overestimate fully-recruited biomass, but the model is able to compensate for this through the random fields when survey data are available. The prediction evaluation results indicate that one-year ahead fully-recruited biomass projections tend to over-estimate the realized biomass unless the productivity parameters for the projections are reduced. The results generally indicate that for both stocks SEAM is an appropriate framework for modelling the stock dyanamics given the available data and can be used as a platform to provide science advice required for these stocks.
