# Introduction

Scallop fishery description. Introduce SFAs and management scheme. The last full assessment for the Offshore Scallop fishery occurred in 2013, and focused on Georges Bank 'a' and Browns Bank north, which are part of SFA 27 and 26, respectively. Annual updates for these two stocks have occurred since***. However, the offshore scallop fishery consists of 9 management units in total. SFA 26 also includes Browns Bank South and German Bank, SFA 27 includes Georges Bank 'b', and SFA 25, known as the eastern scotian shelf, includes management units 25 (Sable and Middle Bank), and 25b (Banquereau Bank). An annual review of fishery and survey data summaries for all 9 stocks occurs as part of the OSAC process, however, the methodology underlying the current fishery and survey summaries has not been peer-reviewed. Furthermore, stock status information has not been published since 2001 for the Eastern Scotian Shelf stocks (Sable and Middle Banks) and 1997 for German Bank; Browns Bank South and Banquereau Bank have not been published before.

## Framework objectives

The objectives of this framework are:  

- To describe the fishery, survey, and biological data informing the assessment of SFAs 25 and 26 (Part 1, this document)
- To evaluate the analysis methodology used to summarize the above data for SFAs 25 and 26 (Part 2, separate document)
- To propose reference points for SFAs 25 and 26 (Part 2, separate document)  

This Data Inputs review document will:  

- Summarize and review the sampling protocols used during the surveys of SFA 25 and 26 over time
- Review the statistical design(s) of the surveys of SFA 25 and 26 over time
- Review the fishery data collected for trips occurring in SFA 25 and 26 (process, volume of data, quality and validation)
- Review the methods used to summarize survey and fishery data into Science advice
- Present the summarized survey and fishery data for each management unit

notes

- tow-by-tow summary. station locations over time?
- clappers only for sable and north
- ts figures for all banks (fishery, abund, biomass, cond)
- survey map for all banks... example for german

# Survey

The Offshore Scallop Survey Database (SCALOFF) contains data collected through Collaborative Agreements (formerly Joint Project Agreements) between DFO Science and the Seafood Producers Association of Nova Scotia (SPANS). The Offshore Scallop Survey collects data on the stocks of Sea Scallop (*Placopecten magellanicus*) on the Scotian Shelf and the Canadian side of Georges Bank, as well as Iceland Scallop (*Chlamys islandica*) on Banquereau Bank. These stocks correspond to the DFO management units known as Scallop Fishing Areas (SFA) 25, 26, and 27, and the survey data are the primary source of fishery-independent information used in the Maritimes Region scallop stock assessments. Under the Collaborative Agreement, survey responsibilities are shared by DFO and SPANS. At-sea survey activities are directed by the DFO Chief Scientist aboard the survey vessel. SPANS coordinates the provision the survey vessel as well as the necessary crew complement to conduct the survey activities. DFO Science designs the survey, provides and manages scientific equipment, and validates, archives, and analyzes survey data. 

## Survey history  

The Offshore Scallop Survey has occurred between May and September annually since 1978 with few exceptions, but spatial coverage and survey designs have changed over time (see Survey Design).  

## Sampling protocols  

Regardless of survey design, the same sampling protocol is followed: At each survey station, the 8-ft scallop dredge lined with 38 mm mesh is towed for 10 minutes, and every scallop is counted and assigned to a 5 mm shell height bin (ranging from 0-200 mm). Detailed sampling occurs at a selection of the stations, where the exact shell heights and meat weights are measured for a sub-sample of the scallops caught. Bottom temperature data has also been collected on the Offshore Scallop survey since 2011.  

As part of the Offshore Scallop Survey protocol, tows are tracked to provide information on location and length (Hubley et al. 2014). Tow lengths can vary due to conditions such as vessel speed, tides, and sea state. For this reason, accurate tow lengths are required to standardize shell height frequency data across tows of various lengths to a common 800m tow length. Over the past two of decades, Ocean Vision was the navigational system used to record tow tracks, but this program has become outdated.  

During the 2022 Offshore Scallop surveys of German Bank, Browns Bank North, and Georges Bank (a and b), the Olex navigational system was trialed as a replacement for Ocean Vision. A total of 449 tows were recorded using both systems. Tow tracking followed the same at-sea protocol as usual, but two systems were used simultaneously. Tow lengths were calculated based on the tracks recorded by each system and compared by tow using the sf package in R. The tows were recorded using the WGS 84 coordinate reference system, but were converted to the appropriate UTM zone for the purposes of length calculation.  

Tows recorded using Olex were found to be longer in length (metres) than tows recorded using Ocean Vision (Figure \@ref(fig:nav-linear)). The median difference in length was 41.5m (or 4%). After standardizing all tows for an 800m tow length, this systematic difference would result in a small negative bias in indices derived from tows recorded using the Olex system compared to historical tows measured with Ocean Vision. To eliminate the bias in tow length (L_tow), a correction factor (φ) of 1.04 was applied to the Olex tow length (L_olex):

L_tow=L_olex/φ

This correction factor will be applied to all future Olex tows to ensure comparability with historical data collected under the Ocean Vision system (Figure \@ref(fig:nav-box)). Historical data collected using Ocean Vision will not be affected by the transition to Olex.
