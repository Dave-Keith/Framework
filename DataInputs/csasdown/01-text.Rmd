# Introduction

The Maritimes Region Offshore Scallop stock is managed using nine management units called Scallop Fishing Areas (SFAs, Figure \@ref(fig:map)). Information on scallop population dynamics within each SFA is provided annually by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Science during meetings of the Offshore Scallop Advisory Committee (OSAC). Stock assessment science advice is also provided annually through the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat (CSAS) using the science advice frameworks established in 2009 [@jonsen_georges_2009] and 2013 [@dfo_assessment_2013; @hubley_georges_2014] for SFA 27A Georges Bank 'a',  and 2011 for SFA 26A Browns Bank north [@hubley_browns_2011]. Stock assessment advice through CSAS was last conducted for SFA 25 Eastern Scotian Shelf (Sable and Middle Banks) in 2001 [@dfo_eastern_2001] and for SFA 26C German Bank in 1997 [@dfo_german_1997]. This CSAS process represents the first time advice on SFA 26B Browns Bank South, SFA 25B Banquereau Bank, and SFA 27B Georges Bank ‘b’ has been presented.

This document will review the available fishery and survey data for SFAs 25, 26 and 27B to support the development of reference points within these management units. Methods used to collect fishery-independent data (e.g. survey design and sampling protocols), and calculate survey indices and model inputs will be reviewed. Methodological changes will be proposed for the relationship between meat weight and shell height, the relationship between shell height and age, and the size of recruit and fully-recruited scallops. 


## Species biology

Sea scallop (_Placopecten magellanicus_) biology is summarized by @jonsen_georges_2009, @naidu_fisheries_2006, and [@shumway_fisheries_2016]. Paraphrasing these summaries, sea scallops are bivalve molluscs that range from North Carolina, US to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. They are broadcast spawners, with pelagic larvae settling on the seafloor at depths of 18–110m after 1–2 months. While largely sessile, juveniles and adults may be able to swim short distances, adjust their orientation or position in the sediment, or attach to substrate with byssus threads. Growth rates are dependent on environmental conditions such as depth and temperature, likely due to the availability of microbial planktonic food sources. Sexual maturation is typical within 3–5 years of age (with shell heights of approximately 75–100 mm).

Recent studies have contributed new information to the biological understanding of sea scallop and the following summary is not exhaustive. For example, scallop growth and condition can depend on depth, location, fishing pressure, and season [@hart_estimating_2009; @hennen_shell_2012; @sarro_spatial_2009]. Recent studies have linked scallop physiology and distribution to environmental variables; growth may be reduced with increasing levels of carbon dioxide [@pousse_juvenile_2023], condition may be correlated with sea surface temperature [@liu_using_2021], and fall scallop biomass may increase under climate change [@friedland_trends_2023]. A lab study of scallop swimming ability observed swimming in scallops up to 100mm in shell height, with swimming duration and distance increasing with shell height [@mason_situ_2014]. Supporting previous studies, scallops on Georges Bank exhibited semiannual spawning patterns, with a spring spawn observed in several years in addition to the primary fall spawn [@thompson_identifying_2014]. Natural mortality was found to be density dependent [@hart_estimating_2022] and the occurrence of grey meats may be due to an apicomplexan parasite [@inglis_gray_2016] coupled with other factors that reduce scallop condition [@siemann_investigating_2019]. In terms of stock assessment modelling, the incorporation of spatial variability and habitat preference [@mcdonald_explicit_2021; @mcdonald_incorporating_2022; @mcdonald_integrating_2023] as well as variability in natural mortality [@hart_estimating_2022] has been shown to reduce prediction uncertainty. 



## Framework objectives

This Data Inputs review document is the first of three research documents that form a broader assessment framework for SFAs 25, 26 and 27B. 

This document will:  

- summarize and review the sampling protocols used during the surveys of SFA 25, 26,and 27B,
- review the statistical design(s) of the surveys of SFA 25, 26, and 27B,
- review fishery data collected for trips occurring in SFA 25, 26, and 27B (process, volume of data, quality and validation),
- review the methods used to summarize survey and fishery data, and
- present the summarized survey and fishery data for each management unit.


# Fishery

The Maritimes Region Offshore Scallop fishery is described in an [Integrated Fisheries Management Plan](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fisheries-peches/ifmp-gmp/scallop-petoncle/2018/index-eng.html) [@dfo_integrated_2024-1] that is updated as needed by DFO Fisheries and Aquaculture Management. To summarize, there are currently six license-holding companies and ten active vessels. The fishery is managed using a total allowable catch (TAC) with Enterprise Allocations for each company based on a percent share of the TAC. In addition to following license conditions related to gear, vessel size, and meat count (the number of scallops in a 500 gram sample), each fishing trip must complete a fishing logbook and participate in dockside monitoring upon landing. These data are used to track landings against the TACs and for stock assessment purposes.

TACs have varied over time, but are consistently highest in SFA 27A (not included here), followed by SFA 26A and 27B (Figure \@ref(fig:hist)). Fishing seasons run from January 1 to December 31 for all SFAs, except SFA 26C German Bank which runs from June 1 to November 15 to avoid gear conflicts with the lobster fishery [@dfo_integrated_2024-1]. Each SFA corresponds to a bathymetric bank, except SFA 25A, which represents the Eastern Scotian Shelf and contains both Sable and Middle Banks. Western Bank is also in SFA 25A and was fished for many years until the Western/Emerald Bank Conservation Area (WEBCA) was established in 2017, which closed it to scallop fishing. Middle Bank is shown separately from Sable Bank in fishery figures presented in this document as the two banks are surveyed separately.

## Fishery history

Historically, Georges Bank has been the primary focus of the Offshore Scallop fishery. In 1977, Canada and the US both declared 200-mile fishing zones. This limited Canadian vessels to fishing a disputed zone of Georges Bank. The dispute and the competitive fishery continued in this area until the International Court of Justice (ICJ) established an international boundary in October 1984, which awarded the Northeast portion of Georges Bank to Canada. The establishment of the ICJ line initiated discussions between DFO and industry on how to rebuild and maintain the Offshore Scallop stocks (for more details see @jonsen_georges_2009). This led to opportunities and interest in the potential exploitation of other banks within the Canadian offshore jurisdiction. In September 1986, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans divided the inshore and Offshore Scallop fleets with a separation at the 43°40’ North latitude line near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. This led to the inshore fleet being phased out of the Georges Bank, Browns Bank and German Bank fisheries over the next few years, while the offshore fleet was not permitted to fish in what were classified as inshore waters [@jonsen_georges_2009]. These changes to the available fishing areas for the offshore fleet led to competition for access to fishing grounds and resulted in the exploitation of all known beds, even in areas quite distant from home ports (e.g. Banquereau) [@robert_scallop_1988]. As a result, the coverage of the DFO survey expanded to cover the new fishing grounds.

Since 2010, the Offshore Scallop fleet has gradually shifted towards the use of factory freezer trawler vessels and automatic shucking machines. This has led to divergence in catch rates between different vessel types that may reflect different fishing strategies. As of 2023, the majority of the fleet (8 out of 10 active vessels) are freezer trawlers. 


## Fishery data

Commercial fishery data are collected from mandatory logbooks submitted by fishers at the end of each trip. Landings are also subject to a port sampling program to independently verify landed weights and identify trends in individual meat weights. Logbook data are subjected to a quality control process to validate information related to location, date, gear, tow duration and number, and landings. For historical consistency, for fishing that occurred prior to 2009, only data that passed historical quality control protocols (and were historically deemed "class 1", meaning that effort data were available and reliable) were used for catch rate calculation; however total effort and total catch includes all records. Logbook and port sampling data up to and including 2022 are used in this document.

In SFA 25, scallop catch has been below 100 tonnes annually in recent years (Figure \@ref(fig:fts-25)). Within SFA 25, landings have traditionally been highest from Sable Bank, however it was last fished in 2021. Fishing has occurred over much of Middle and Sable Bank since 1980, with landings highest in the western portion of Sable Bank, and southeast of Middle Bank (Figure \@ref(fig:foot-25)). Fishing on Banquereau has been targeted to small areas, possibly due to the discontinuous fishing activity over time (Figure \@ref(fig:foot-25)). Fishing effort has been below 50,000 hour-metres annually in all SFA 25 management units since 2000, with catch rates (kilograms per hour-metre; kg/hm) below 10 kg/hm in most years. Catch rates were above 10 kg/hm in SFA 25B Banquereau in some years, but this area was fished in fewer years overall. Meat weights varied within and between management units in SFA 25 (Table \@ref(tab:ps-tab)). On Sable Bank, the year with the highest median annual meat weight was 2012, though relatively few samples were collected that year (Figure \@ref(fig:mw-annual)).

In SFA 26, scallop catch varies between management units. SFA 26A Browns Bank north has been below 500 tonnes in recent years, but has exceeded 1,000 tonnes historically, while SFA 26B Browns Bank south and 26C German Bank have each been below 250 tonnes in most years (Figure \@ref(fig:fts-26)). Fishing on SFA 26B Browns Bank south is more sporadic than on SFA 26A Browns Bank north or SFA 26C German Bank; for example, SFA 26B Browns Bank south was not fished from 2014--2016 or 2020--2021 (Figure \@ref(fig:fts-26)). Fishing effort has rarely exceeded 50,000 hour-metres in any of the SFA 26 management units, while catch rates (kilograms per hour-metre) have been variable (Figure \@ref(fig:fts-26)). Fishing has occurred throughout SFA 26 since 1980, but overall catches have been highest on SFA 26A Browns Bank north, particularly in the northern half of the management unit (Figure \@ref(fig:foot-26)). Meat weights varied within and between management units in SFA 26, with the long term medians for SFA 26A Browns Bank north, SFA 26B Browns Bank south and SFA 26C German Bank were 17.43, 11.07, and 18.89, respectively (Table \@ref(tab:ps-tab)). On SFA 26A Browns Bank north, the year with the highest median annual meat weight was 2008 (Figure \@ref(fig:mw-annual)).

In SFA 27B, annual scallop catch has generally been below 750 tonnes (Figure \@ref(fig:fts-27)). The area has been fished every year since 1981, except 2011. Fishing effort has rarely exceeded 30,000 hour-metres since 2002, while catch rates have increased over time and exceed 20 kg/hm in recent years (Figure \@ref(fig:fts-27)). Fishing has occurred throughout SFA 27B since 1980, and catches are usually highest along the border with SFA27A (Figure \@ref(fig:foot-27)). Meat weights varied in SFA 27B, with a long term median of 36, which is above SFA 26A Browns Bank north but below SFA 26B Browns Bank south (Table \@ref(tab:ps-tab)). 


# Survey

The DFO Maritimes Offshore Scallop Survey occurs through Collaborative Agreements (formerly Joint Project Agreements) between DFO Science and the Seafood Producers Association of Nova Scotia (SPANS). The survey collects data on Sea Scallop (*Placopecten magellanicus*) on the Scotian Shelf and the Canadian side of Georges Bank, and on Iceland Scallop (*Chlamys islandica*) on Banquereau Bank. The survey occurs in multiple subareas within SFAs 25, 26, and 27, with survey data being the primary source of fishery-independent information used in the Maritimes Region scallop stock assessments. Under the Collaborative Agreement, survey responsibilities are shared by DFO and SPANS. At-sea survey activities are directed by the DFO Chief Scientist aboard the survey vessel. SPANS coordinates the provision the survey vessel and the necessary crew complement to conduct the survey activities. DFO Science designs the survey, provides and manages scientific equipment, and validates, archives, and analyzes survey data. Survey data up to 2022 are used in this document.

## Survey history  

While survey tows have occurred on Georges Bank 'b' (SFA 27B) since 1978, the first official surveys of Browns Bank North (now SFA 26A, then called Browns Bank) and German Bank (now SFA 26C) occurred in 1979. The surveys were funded by DFO and conducted on the CCGS E.E. Prince. In general, these surveys were designed using a stratification scheme based on catches or catch rates reported in commercial fishery logbooks [@jamieson_commercial_1986]. Strata for each bank were defined annually based on logbook records from the previous year of fishing on the bank. Station allocation was approximately proportional to the area of each stratum, but adjusted such that the highest catch stratum was allocated more stations than the lower catch rate strata [@jamieson_commercial_1986]. Station locations were randomly assigned within each stratum based on the year’s allocation scheme. 

Middle Bank (part of SFA 25A) was added to the survey in 1983, followed by Sable and Western Banks (also part of SFA 25A) in 1984 [@robert_scallop_1985]. For the next decade, survey coverage depended on the levels of fishing activity/effort on the individual banks with occasional limited surveys of Banquereau Bank (SFA 25B). The area surveyed on each bank (or “survey domain”) changed significantly during these years [@robert_scallop_1987]. Stratification methods also varied between management units and over time. The evolving survey designs are detailed by bank in Section 3.4 Survey Design. 

During this period, there were additional projects (not detailed here) included in the survey activities, including scallop tagging, phytoplankton and larval sampling, monitoring of juvenile hake within scallops, monitoring of epiphytes, genetic analysis, and meat sampling for heavy metal analysis. 

In 1994, the CCGS E.E. Prince was slated for retirement. Under the shared stewardship arrangement between the Offshore Scallop industry and DFO, the industry provided and crewed a commercial scallop Fishing Vessel (FV), FV Cape Keltic, to conduct the annual stock assessment surveys of the Offshore Scallop banks under the direction of a DFO Biologist [@dfo_integrated_2024-1]. Comparative survey towing activities took place on Middle (12 tows), Sable (58 tows), Browns North (30 tows) and Georges Banks (12 tows) in 1994. Since this time there have been three additional vessel changes; no comparative surveys were undertaken for these vessel changes. In 2007 and 2008, the survey took place on the FV E.E. Pierce, from 2009--2014 the survey took place on the FV Tenacity and starting in 2015 the FV Fundy Leader has been used for the survey. 

In 2015, there were delays in survey vessel preparations and therefore survey operations. Due to the delays, Middle and Sable Banks were not surveyed. Browns Bank North was surveyed in July/August (with additional tows taking place in late September), and German Bank was surveyed in September.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a limited survey of Browns Bank North and the northern portion of Georges Bank was conducted by industry partners with logistical support from DFO Science but no DFO Science leadership on the vessel [@dfo_stock_2022]. A selection of stations from the 2018 and 2019 surveys of these banks formed the survey design in 2020. These data were collected for informational purposes only since the approved survey design was not used; they were not included in stock assessment analysis and are not included in this document.

## Sampling protocols  

Regardless of survey design, the same sampling protocol is followed: at each survey station, a 2.44 m New Bedford style scallop dredge (75 mm ring size) lined with 38 mm polypropylene netting used to conduct tows at predetermined locations. Each survey tow occurs for 10 minutes at a speed of 3 to 4 knots.

The scallop catch from each tow is sorted into baskets (for scallops > 50 mm) and buckets (for scallops ≤ 50 mm or less). The individual scallops’ shell heights are measured to the nearest 5 mm and their mortality state (dead or alive) is recorded.

At the start of the survey time series, biological samples of 30 scallops were taken from a tow every 10 minute square of latitude and longitude. The scallops were dissected into meat, gonad, and soft parts while on board the vessel. The individual components were then frozen while at sea. In a DFO lab onshore at a later date the biological components were thawed, weighed (wet and dry weight), had their shell heights measured precisely (to the nearest 0.1 mm instead of using the 5 mm bins) and aged. In Summer of 2010, the procedure was revised such that only meat weight and shell height information were collected, but for an increased number of scallops; this sampling process now takes place exclusively on the vessel during the survey. The relationship between the shell height and adductor muscle weight is particularly useful for monitoring the condition of scallops in a given place and time [@hubley_browns_2011].

Tows are tracked using a global positioning system (GPS) to provide information on location and length [@hubley_georges_2014]. Tow lengths can vary due to conditions such as vessel speed, tides, and sea state. For this reason, accurate tow lengths are required to standardize shell height frequency data across tows of various lengths to a common 800 m tow length. Over the past two of decades, Ocean Vision was the navigational system used to record tow tracks, but this program has become outdated.

During the 2022 DFO Maritimes Offshore Scallop Survey of German Bank, Browns Bank North, and Georges Bank ('a' and 'b'), the Olex navigational system was trialed as a replacement for Ocean Vision. A total of 449 tows were recorded using both systems. Tow tracking followed the same at-sea protocol as usual, but two systems were used simultaneously. Tow lengths were calculated based on the tracks recorded by each system and compared by tow using the sf package in R [@pebesma_simple_2018]. The tows were recorded using the WGS 84 coordinate reference system, but were converted to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system for the purposes of length calculation (the UTM zone for each management unit is provided in \@ref:(tab:strata-tab)). 

Tows recorded using Olex were found to be longer in length (metres) than tows recorded using Ocean Vision (Figure \@ref(fig:nav-linear)). The median difference in length was 41.5m (or 4%). After standardizing all tows for an 800m tow length, this systematic difference would result in a small negative bias in indices derived from tows recorded using the Olex system compared to historical tows measured with Ocean Vision. To eliminate the bias in tow length ($L_{tow}$), a correction factor ($\delta$) of 1.04 was applied to the Olex tow length ($L_{olex}$) using Equation 1:

$$L_{tow} = \frac{L_{olex}} {\delta}$$ 

This correction factor will be applied to all future Olex tows to ensure comparability with historical data collected under the Ocean Vision system (Figure \@ref(fig:nav-box)). Historical data collected using Ocean Vision will not be affected by the transition to Olex.

## Survey database

The Offshore Scallop assessment survey data (1978--Present) are housed in an internal DFO Oracle database called SCALOFF. As annual surveys take place, data are validated and uploaded to SCALOFF. This allows for consistent data handling, quality control, and data security. 

## Survey design  

Survey design details are presented by SFA in the following order to align with the chronological expansion of the DFO Maritimes Offshore Scallop Survey across the Scotian Shelf over time: SFA 26 (began in 1978), SFA27B (began in 1978), SFA 25 (began in 1983).

### SFA 26

#### Browns Bank north (SFA 26A) and Browns Bank south (SFA 26B)

The first opportunistic survey in 1978 consisted of 7 randomly selected stations in areas where the commercial fleet was active. The following year, an official survey took place using randomly selected locations, allocated within a grid of 10-minute (10') cells of latitude and longitude and based on scallop fishing activity. In 1981, the survey domain consisted of 10' grid cells with at least 10 days of fishing reported in commercial fishing logbooks from September 1980 to June 1981. A catch percentage was calculated for each grid cell by dividing the commercial fishery catch in the cell by the total commercial fishery catch on the bank. Cells were then separated into 4 strata levels (deemed Low, Medium, High and Exploratory) based on arbitrary catch percentage thresholds. For example, in 1984, 20 stations were to be surveyed. The High stratum on Browns Bank represented cells with >10% total catch, which covered 66% of the survey domain, so 10 stations were allocated. The Medium stratum contained cells with 4--10% of the total catch, covering 25% of the survey domain, and thus receiving 7 stations. The Low stratum represented cells with 0--4% of the total catch, covered 8% total area, and therefore was allocated 3 stations. 

Within each stratum, the allocated stations were placed randomly. Some station locations were adjusted due to unsuitable substrate for towing. Similar methodology was used in subsequent years with the catch strata levels and strata areas being refined annually to reflect the catch rates experienced during fishing activities. The 1982 survey was cancelled due to weather. In 1985, an Exploratory stratum was added to Browns Bank to allow survey stations to occur in an area that was not fished in 1984, that had high numbers of age 2 scallops in previous surveys [@robert_scallop_1986]. In 1988 and 1989 the Browns Bank survey was cancelled due to a lack of fishing activity [@robert_scallop_1989].

An experimental fishery and management plan was implemented in 1989 for Browns Bank. Exploitation increased substantially because there had been an accumulation of biomass due to lack of fishing activity and there was a perception that the bank could potentially sustain long-term continuous exploitation [@robert_scallop_1990]. The 1990 survey focused on the areas fished during the experimental fishery since there had been little fishing activity for several years before this.

In 1994, comparative surveys took place using the retiring CCGS E.E Prince and the industry supplied commercial scallop dragger, FV Cape Keltic to facilitate the change to a new survey vessel. There were no significant differences between the two vessels in estimates of biomass per tow for shell height classes over 100mm [@robert_status_1995], so the survey time series was treated as continuous (no conversion factor applied). The catch distribution from the previous 9 months derived from log records was used to stratify survey stations which were randomized within Low, Medium and High strata. A Very High stratum was also added in 1994 to reduce the variability in the High stratum given the catch-rates observed. In future years, an Exploratory stratum was occasionally added to address any areas that warranted additional investigation [@robert_status_1997].

In the fall of 1994, an additional survey took place on the south side of Browns Bank. The areas sampled were based on the locations fished between 1976 and 1985 and set in a grid pattern [@robert_status_1995]. This led to the expansion of the survey area in 1995 and 1996. Areas previously fished accounted for 64% of the total survey area in these years [@robert_status_1997].

In the late 1990s, information from a multibeam bathymetric survey (Canadian Hydrographic Service and Atlantic Geological Survey of Canada) of a portion of Browns Bank became available and was used in planning survey tows and towing direction [@kostylev_benthic_2001]. These mapping data provided higher resolution delineation of bottom type and topography. The introduction of bottom mapping data led to a re-evaluation of effort and catch-rate measurements used for the survey design [@robert_browns_1998].

By 2001, the relationship between bottom type (surficial geology) and scallop abundance was better understood. As a result, the stratification scheme for the survey was changed to a design based on surficial geology [@kostylev_benthic_2001; @kostylev_stock_2003]. The survey stations were randomly selected and allocated proportionally to area for the 5 surficial geology strata; the 5 strata were gravel lag with thin sand, gravel lag, thin sand over gravel lag, thick sand, and sand with barchans. Surficial geology strata were fixed from year to year between 2001 and 2012 (Tables 1 and 2). Additionally in 2001, Browns Bank was divided into North and South management areas and the areas were assigned separate surveys [@hubley_browns_2011]. 

Since 2011, Browns Bank south has not been surveyed every year, but the intermittent surveys continue to use the surficial geology design for stratification. However, on Browns Bank north, over time it became evident that the surficial geology were unable to account for the spatial variability in scallop abundance [@hubley_georges_2014]. A 2013 science and industry working group recommended a change in design to fixed strata that were based on a more direct measure of scallop abundance. The historical commercial catch rate (HCR) for 2002--2012 was chosen as a stratifying variable because of limited survey coverage in previous years. This new design had significant gains in realized and potential efficiency [@hubley_georges_2014]. The survey strata area were refined in 2021 and is the current design used for Browns Bank north, while surficial geology strata are still used for Browns Bank south (Table \@ref(tab:strata-tab), Figures \@ref(fig:map-bbn) and \@ref(fig:map-bbs)). 

#### German Bank (SFA 26C)

In 1979, the first official survey on German Bank took place using a random station design allocated using a 10’ square grid and the amount of scallop fishing activity that took place.

In 1981, sampling locations were determined from commercial fishing activity from September 1980 to June 1981. Unit areas (10’) with 10 days of fishing were separated into four strata levels based on landings from the unit area. Some station locations were adjusted due to unsuitable substrate for towing. At the start of the survey series, German Bank was surveyed using a 38 mm liner in the dredge but upon experiencing extensive damage to the liner due to the bathymetry of the area, it was decided to survey the area without a liner. 

The 1982 survey was cancelled due to weather. In 1983, station locations were randomly assigned within the 10’ units with at least 5 fishing days according to a Low, Medium, and High strata defined by percentage total catch for the area. An example of how the catch stratification was implemented can be found using the 1984 data, in this year, German strata were defined as High (>10% of total catch), Medium (4--10% of total catch) and Low (<4% of total catch). From 1986 to 1993 German Bank was not surveyed due to lack of fishing activity in the area [@robert_scallop_1991].

In the Fall of 1994, survey operations resumed on German Bank after an 8 year hiatus (there was no fishing activity for 7 years). This survey took place using the industry supplied commercial scallop dragger, FV Cape Keltic. This survey covered areas south of the 43°40’ line and occurred after the lobster season to avoid gear conflicts. The restriction on the area surveyed was due to the inshore/offshore fleet separation that occurred in December of 1986 [@robert_activity_1995]. For surveys in 1994--1996, the commercial fishery logbook catch records from the previous year were used to stratify survey stations (similar to Browns Bank). An Exploratory stratum was occasionally added to the survey and the area surveyed depended on the location of the fishing activity in the previous year [@robert_activity_1995; @robert_status_1997].

In 1997 and 1998 the German Bank survey was cancelled due to a lack of fishing activity. Survey activities resumed in 1999 with the same catch stratification methodology. Starting in 2003, a subset of the survey stations were repeated from the previous surveys, this was undertaken to better understand and improve the evaluation of the stock in this area. This continued until 2008. 

In 2008, a trial was conducted in which 30 of the 80 planned survey tows and one exploratory tow used a 38 mm mesh polypropylene netting liner. The results of this trial, along with an accumulation of German Bank survey experience and the addition of high resolution bathymetry maps, led to the use of lined gear from this point forward. In addition, from 2009 onwards the survey design was revamped to a sampling with partial replacement design [@warren_potential_1994], following the methods of @smith_scallop_2007. For this design, 25% of the stations are randomly selected from stations conducted in the previous year and 75% of the stations are randomly generated from areas with towable bottom (Table \@ref(tab:strata-tab), Figure \@ref(fig:map-ger)).

#### SFA 26 Overview

Spatial analysis shows the coverage and variability of survey tow locations in SFA 26 (Figure \@ref(fig:sfoot-26)). There have been more stations per 10km^2^ cell on Browns Bank North than the other two areas due to the annual survey frequency and number of tows each year.

### SFA 27B

#### Georges Bank 'b' (SFA 27B)

Survey tows have been conducted on Georges Bank 'b' annually since 1978, consistent with the Georges Bank survey description by [@jonsen_georges_2009]. The majority of the tows have occurred in August since the beginning of the time series, with some additional tows occurring in May or June in most years. Initially, the survey covered Georges Bank as a whole with 150 stations, using 4--6 strata based on annual commercial fishery logbook catch rate, and a variable number of tows occurred on Georges Bank 'b' each year. In 2009, a stratification scheme was proposed for the August survey of Georges Bank 'a' based on the survey abundance index from 1981--2008, resulting in seven strata [@hubley_georges_2009]. A similar approach was used for Georges Bank 'b', resulting in five strata that have been used since 2009 with 30 stations surveyed annually in August (Table \@ref(tab:strata-tab), Figure \@ref(fig:map-gbb)). The spring monitoring survey of Georges Bank also includes 4 stations on Georges Bank 'b', but given the limited nature of this survey, these data are not presented here. Over time, more tows have occurred near the boundary between Georges Bank 'a' and 'b' than along the slope of the bank (Figure \@ref(fig:sfoot-27)).

### SFA 25

#### Sable Bank (SFA 25A)

In 1983, Sable/Western Bank was added to the survey due to fishing effort expanding to the Eastern Scotian Shelf, however the 1983 survey was cancelled due to weather conditions, so the first survey occurred in 1984 [@robert_scallop_1985]. At this time, both Sable and Western Banks were open to fishing. The survey domain consisted of cells within a 10' square grid of the bank that had at least 5 days of fishing. While a stratified survey design was used, stratification was based on commercial fishery logbook catch instead of catch rate (the method used for SFAs 26 and 27 at that time). A catch percentage was calculated for each grid cell by dividing the catch in the cell by the total commercial fishery catch on the bank. Three strata were created by arbitrarily dividing the resulting percentages into three groups, one with high catch percentages, one with medium percentages, and the third deemed Low. In 1984, the High stratum consisted of grid cells with >8% of the commercial fishery catch on Sable/Western. This stratum covered 45% of the survey domain, and was assigned 13 stations. The Medium stratum consisted of grid cells with 4--8% of the commercial fishery catch on Sable/Western, and covered 33% of the survey domain, so was assigned 13 stations. The Low stratum consisted of grid cells with 0-4% of the commercial fishery catch on Sable/Western, and covered 23% of the survey domain, so was assigned 14 stations.

In 1986, the catch on Sable/Western Bank was the highest it had ever been [@robert_scallop_1987], which was attributed to the new Enterprise Allocation (EA) management approach. The Sable/Western survey domain expanded significantly from 1986 to 1990 to accommodate the changing fleet dynamics [@robert_scallop_1988; @robert_scallop_1990].

In 1991, a reduced survey occurred with 76 of the 90 planned survey stations completed. The High stratum was completed as planned, the Medium stratum was missing 2 tows, and only 50% of the planned tows in the Low stratum were completed [@robert_scallop_1992]. In 1994, a comparative survey was also undertaken on Sable/Western Bank [@robert_activity_1995]. As with other areas, there were no apparent differences in estimates of biomass per tow for scallop shell height classes over 100mm [@robert_status_1995], so the survey time series was treated as continuous (no conversion factor applied). In 1994, stratification using the 1993 catch would have provided poor coverage since fishing activities were spatially limited; 29 stations were allocated using the stratification scheme, and an additional 29 survey stations were added to an Exploratory stratum to cover areas that were unfished at that time. The stations conducted on Sable/Western Bank in 1994 were repeated in 1995 to provide a baseline of scallop abundance [@robert_scallop_1996].

In the next few years, exploratory tows were added to the stratified survey (within an Exploratory stratum) to cover grounds fished in the past on Sable/Western Bank. From 1999--2009, the survey design was based on the catch rate stratification methodology and 135 stations were sampled each year. 

From 2010 onwards, the stratification has been based on the historical survey index  (Table \@ref(tab:strata-tab)). There was a reduction in survey stations in 2012 due to reduced fishing effort and area covered by the fleet. The survey area (domain) was further reduced in 2018 due to the implementation of the WEBCA in 2017 [@dfo_integrated_2024-1]. The most recent survey of Sable Bank is mapped in Figure \@ref(fig:map-sab). 

#### Middle Bank (SFA 25A)

In 1983, Middle Bank was added to the DFO Maritimes Offshore Scallop Survey plan due to fishing effort expanding to the Eastern Scotian Shelf [@robert_scallop_1985]. As on Sable/Western Bank, the survey followed a stratified design based on catch as reported in commercial fishery logbooks. In 1984, the Middle Bank survey used two strata. The High strata consisted of 10' grid cells that contained >7% of the commercial fishery logbook catch on the bank, and covered 60% of the survey domain, so 12 of the 20 stations were randomly allocated to High strata. The remaining 8 stations were randomly allocated to the Low strata (<7% of the catch, and covering the remaining 40% of the survey domain). This design was used between 1984 and 1988, with a total of 6 to 20 stations surveyed per year.

There was no survey between 1989 and 1991 [@robert_scallop_1991]. In 1992, there were 8 catch rate stratified tows [@robert_scallop_1993]. Due to low stock levels and minimal fishing activity the survey was cancelled in 1993 [@robert_status_1994].

For the 1994 survey, exploratory tows were added to the catch rate stratified survey allocation due to limited fishing activity in 1993 to improve coverage; 12 tows were conducted [@robert_scallop_1996]. This survey was included in the comparative survey between the CCGS E.E. Prince and the industry supplied FV Cape Keltic. From 1994--1996, the Middle Bank survey used the same 12 stations. In 1997, three additional stations were added and this survey design has not changed since; it is now considered to be a fixed survey design (Table \@ref(tab:strata-tab), Figure \@ref(fig:map-mid)). 

#### Banquereau Bank (SFA 25B)

The first survey on Banquereau Bank was an extension of the survey that was taking place on Sable/Western Bank in 1985. Over the next two decades there were a few years (1987, 1988, 1999) with limited and irregular surveys that employed a simple random sampling design that was informed by historical catch rates (Table \@ref(tab:strata-tab)). 

In absence of new knowledge of scallop distribution, the 2006 survey repeated 15 of the 18 survey tows from 1999, plus an additional 3 exploratory tows. The stations sampled in 2012 were random but informed by fishing effort distribution, these stations were repeated in 2019 with three additional exploratory stations. 

On Banquereau Bank, Sea scallops and Icelandic scallops both occur in harvestable quantities. In 2006, 2012, and 2019, both Sea scallops and Icelandic scallops were measured and enumerated separately but with the same onboard procedures to provide abundance estimates for both scallop species (2019 stations are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:map-ban)). 

#### SFA 25 Overview

Spatial analysis shows the coverage and variability of survey tow locations in SFA 25 (Figure \@ref(fig:sfoot-25)). On Middle Bank, the number of survey tows in some 10km^2^ cells is high because of the fixed survey design, whereas the stratification approach on Sable Bank leads to a broader and more even coverage.



# Estimation methods

## Meat weight-shell height relationship

Detailed meat weight-shell height samples are collected from a subset of scallop in a tow, and from a subset of tows. A meat weight-shell height (MWSH) model is therefore used to estimate the total biomass by tow of both subsampled tows, and tows without detailed sampling data. The current approach to model MWSH is a two step-approach which makes model evaluation challenging [@hubley_georges_2014]. The method presented here is a one-step model based on the MWSH model used for other scallop stocks [@nasmith_scallop_2016; @hennen_shell_2012], using data from SFA 25A and 26A.

The model used for the analysis is a generalized mixed effects model which is fit annually to the data (Equation 2), where $wmw$ represents wet meat weight in g and $sh$ is shell height in mm of a sampled scallop $i$ from a sampled tow location $l$ with a given depth. Shell height was log-transformed and centred at 100 mm, while depth was centred at the median depth of measurements from each management unit. Tow location $l$ was treated as a random intercept.


$$log(wmw_{il}) \sim Gamma(\mu, \phi)$$
$$E(log(wmw_{il})) = \mu$$
$$var(log(wmw_{il})) = \frac{\mu^2}{\phi}$$
$$log(wmw_{il}) = log(sh_{il}) + depth_l + E$$ 
$$tow_l \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$


More complex mixed effects models were tested (e.g., enabling the shell height ‘slope’ to vary by tow, models using all years of data with a year effect) but were not pursued due to convergence issues. In addition, analogous generalized linear models (with no random effects) were run to explore the effect of year and depth on the model results; these models indicated that both year and depth have significant effects on the model results (Table \@ref(tab:mwsh-tab)), but the residuals from these models indicated that there were additional tow effects that these models could not capture.

For both management units, the model fits were reasonable in all years (Figures \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-1), \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-2), \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-3), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-1), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-2), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-3)). The residual patterns identify a slight bias in the scallop MW estimates for the smallest and largest sized scallop in some years (Figures \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-rs-1), \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-rs-2), \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-rs-3), \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-rm-1), \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-rm-2), \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-rm-3), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-rs-1), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-rs-2), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-rs-3), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-rm-1), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-rm-2),\@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-rm-3)). The effect of depth on the predictions also varied over time for both management units (Figures \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-depth), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-depth)).

Applying the MWSH modelling approach results in changes to the estimation of condition. Condition is now a direct estimate of the weight of a scallop with a 100 mm shell height, whereas it was an estimate of condition factor in terms of scallop volume (g/dm^3^) before. It was also decided that condition should only be estimated for years with detailed MWSH measurements. For SFA 25, as a result of these changes, condition in recent years is estimated to be higher than the condition factor of a 100 mm shell height scallop calculated via the previous method (Figure \@ref(fig:cfts-25)). Within SFA 25A, condition has typically been higher on Middle Bank than on Sable Bank. In SFA 26A Browns Bank north and SFA 26B Browns Bank south, the new MWSH model approach led to higher condition estimates than the previos method since 2012 (Figure \@ref(fig:cfts-26)). The new MWSH model produced comparable condition estimates for SFA 26C German Bank, with no consistent pattern between the results from the two methods (Figure \@ref(fig:cfts-26)). Likewise for SFA 27B Georges Bank 'b'; the new method produced comparable condition estimates to the previous method (Figure \@ref(fig:cfts-27)).  


## Ageing

The relationship between shell height and age have historically been described using Von Bertalanffy (VonB) growth models. In the 2014 assessment the VonB parameters for Browns Bank north were determined to be  $L_{\infty}$ = 148, $K$ = 0.19, and $t_{0}$ = 0.11 based on incremental aging of four scallop shells from 2012 [@hubley_georges_2014]. Ageing of scallop shells from SFA 25 has not occurred previously. @hubley_georges_2014 attributed differences between their parameters and previous results to spatial variability in growth rates. 

For this framework, new samples from Sable Bank (95 shells from 19 tows, collected in 2016) and Brown Bank north (201 shells from 28 tows, collected in 2011 and 2012) were incrementally aged (Table \@ref(tab:age-summary)) using the shell analysis methods of @hart_estimating_2009. Shells collected from Browns Bank north in 2012 were chosen for comparability to the shells aged by @hubley_georges_2014. Each increment between rings of shell growth was measured to the nearest millimetre, resulting in 383 and 804 measurements for Sable and Browns Bank north, respectively. As such, more measurements were available for increments of age 2--3 than those of older ages (and larger shell height); however, measurements were obtained for ages up to 10 (Table \@ref(tab:age-inc)). For a given age increment, measurements from Browns Bank north were approximately 5--15mm larger than from Sable Bank (Table \@ref(tab:age-inc)). 

VonB growth models were developed using nonlinear least squares (NLS), with starting values of $L_\infty$ = 150, $K$ = 0.3 and $t_0$ = 0 (Equation 3). Confidence intervals (95%) were calculated using bootstrapping for the NLS models. 

$$L_{t} = (L_\infty - l_{\infty,l})(1-e^{(K-k_t)(t-t_0)}) $$


For Sable Bank, the growth parameters based on increment measurements were $L_{\infty}$ = 159.2, $K$ = 0.2, and $t_{0}$ = 0.2  (Figure \@ref(fig:vb-sab)). For a scallop with a 90 mm shell height (minimum fully-recruited size), the model estimated an age of 4.46 years. The estimated minimum shell height of recruit scallop one year prior was 74.96 mm ((Figure \@ref(fig:vb-sab)). Residuals of the proposed model were unbiased (Figure \@ref(fig:resid-sab)). 

For Browns Bank north, the growth parameters based on increment measurements were L∞ = 164.4, K = 0.2, and t0 = -0.2  (Figure \@ref(fig:vb-bbn)). For a scallop with a 90 mm shell height (minimum fully-recruited size), the model estimated an age of 3.81 years. The estimated minimum shell height of recruit scallop one year prior was 73.66 mm (Figure \@ref(fig:vb-bbn)). Residuals of the proposed model were unbiased (Figure \@ref(fig:resid-bbn)). 


## Recuit size range

Estimates of scallop age relative to shell height are used to understand growth rates. The stock assessment model uses a separate biomass estimate and growth rate for fully-recruited scallops (scallops that are landed by the fishery), and recruiting scallops (scallops that will be fully-recruited size in one year). While survey data provide information on the overall size structure of the scallop populations, the definition of recruitment depends on the size of the scallops that are actually landed by the fishery. The recruit size range used in DFO Maritimes Science analyses has traditionally varied across offshore scallop management units. Since 2015, SFA 25 subareas have used 80--90mm, SFA 26A, 26B and 27B have used 85--95mm, and SFA 26C has used 95-105mm. These ranges warrant occasional re-evaluation to ensure that they are still appropriate for use in analyses and stock assessment modelling. For the two areas for which models are being developed as part of this Framework (SFA 25A and SFA26A, in a separate document), there is a need to determine the minimum shell height of scallops landed by the fishery and the shell height of those scallops one year prior.

The above meat weight-shell height relationships were used to estimate the shell heights of fully-recruited scallop landed by the fishery, based on the meat weights from the port sampling data in SFA 25A and SFA 26A. The annual MWSH models for SFA 25A and 26A were used to convert the port sampling meat weights to expected shell heights. Given the known seasonal variability in scallop meat weight [e.g. @hennen_shell_2012; @sarro_spatial_2009], an additional analysis was undertaken using port sampling data from April to August (inclusive) only. This period of time corresponds to the period in which most fishing activity occurs, and is prior to the fall spawning period when meat weights typically decline [@hennen_shell_2012; @sarro_spatial_2009].

The shell heights of meats landed in SFA 25A were estimated to range between 65 and 190 mm (Figure \@ref(fig:sh-ps-sab)). The median annual (based on survey year) proportion of meats below 90 mm in SFA 25A was 0.016 (Figure \@ref(fig:prop-ps-sab)) and 0.017 using the April--August data (Figure \@ref(fig:propss-ps-sab)). In SFA26A, the shell heights of landed meats were estimated to range between 65 and 195 mm (Figure \@ref(fig:sh-ps-bbn)). The median annual (based on survey year) proportion of meats below 90 mm in SFA 26A was 0.004 (Figure \@ref(fig:prop-ps-bbn)) and 0.005 using the April--August data (Figure \@ref(fig:propss-ps-bbn)). As such, for the purposes of developing the stock assessment models for SFA 25A and 26A, the shell height of fully-recruited scallop is assumed to be ≥90mm.

The estimated shell heights of scallops landed by the fishery were compared to the shell heights of scallops counted during the surveys to determine if the fishery is size-selective. For both SFA 25A and SFA 26A, there were differences in the proportions of scallops in each 5mm shell height bin between the survey catch and fishery catch in May and June matched on survey year (Figure \@ref(fig:sh-sel-sab) and \@ref(fig:sh-sel-bbn)). The fishery tended to catch higher proportions of large scallop than the survey. This indicates that the fishery is size-selective to some extent, which highlights the need for continued port sampling data collection.

Combining the estimates of minimum fully-recruited size derived from the port sampling data using the proposed meat weight-shell height model, and the estimates of minimum recruit size derived from the ageing estimates, a new recruit size range for SFA 25 and 26 of 75--90 mm is recommended. To evaluate the impact of the new recruit size range on survey indices, recruit abundance and biomass estimates (per tow) were calculated using 75--90mm range, and the previously used range (80--90 mm for SFA 25A and 85-95mm for SFA26A). For SFA 25A, the range of 75--90 mm resulted in higher abundance and biomass estimates of recruits than the previously used range (Figure \@ref(fig:rec-comp-25)). For SFA 26A, there was no clear pattern in the estimates of recruit abundance and biomass per tow when comparing the range of 75--90mm to the previously used range (Figure \@ref(fig:rec-comp-26)). Given that the previous recruit size range was the same between SFAs 25A and 25B, and between SFAs 26A and 26B, it is assumed that the new range applies to these management units, and will be applied in the associated survey indices presented here. SFA 26C has traditionally used a different recruit size range from all other management units, and is not being modelled in this Framework, so the recruit size range will remain the same as in the past. 


# Model inputs

## Survey indices

Abundance and biomass survey indices for SFA 25 subareas, SFA 26 subareas, and SFA 27B are provided in Figures \@ref(fig:sts-25), \@ref(fig:sts-26), and \@ref(fig:sts-27), respectively. Long term medians (up to and including 2022) are provided in \@ref(tab:sts-ltm).

Shell height frequencies based on the 5mm shell height bins are provided in Figures \@ref(fig:shf-ban) to \@ref(fig:shf-gbb) for each management unit. Figures displaying shell height frequencies for shell height bins of 70mm and above are in Appendix A. 
 

## Growth

Growth was estimated using the methods presented here, and compared to the previous method used for Browns Bank north [@dfo_stock_2023-1; @hubley_browns_2011]. The new method resulted in higher growth estimates for both recruit and fully-recruited scallop size classes (Figure \@ref(fig:growth-26)). 


## Mortality

Natural mortality is estimated using the number of empty, but paired and hinged, scallop shells (known as "clappers") counted during the survey. Annual estimates of natural mortality are presented as a proportion relative to the total number of live and dead scallops counted during the survey (Equation 4) in Figures \@ref(fig:cts-25) to \@ref(fig:cts-27), with long term medians in Table \@ref(tab:tab-sts). 

$$\frac{N_{clapper}}{N_{live} + N_{clapper}} * 100$$

Estimates of relative fishing mortality were calculated by comparing the annual landings $B_{fishery}$ to survey biomass estimates $B_{survey}$ (Equation 5) based on survey year (June to May for SFAs 25 and 26, September to August for SFA 27B) and are presented in Figure \@ref(fig:relf). Catchability was not factored into this estimate.

$$\frac{B_{fishery}}{B_{survey}}$$

# Summary

This document presents the fishery and survey data used for the provision of stock assessment advice in SFAs 25, 26, and 27B. A new approach was developed for meat weight-shell height modelling for SFAs 25, 26 and 27B, resulting in estimates of condition instead of condition factor. Age analysis resulted in new VonB curves for SFA 25A Sable Bank and SFA 26A Browns Bank north. Combining annual growth information with port sampling data informed changes to the recruit size range for SFA 25A, 25B, 26A, and 26B. The survey indices of biomass, growth, and natural mortality provided here may be used in the observation equation of a state-space delay-difference population model.
