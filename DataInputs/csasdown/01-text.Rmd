# Introduction

The Maritimes Region Offshore Scallop stock is managed using nine management units called Scallop Fishing Areas (SFAs, Figure \@ref(fig:map)). Information on scallop population dynamics within each SFA is provided annually by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) during meetings of the Offshore Scallop Advisory Committee (OSAC). Stock assessment science advice is also provided annually for SFA 27A Georges Bank 'a' and SFA 26A Browns Bank north using the framework established in 2009 [@jonsen_georges_2009] and accepted during the peer-reviewed Regional Advisory Process of 2013 [@dfo_assessment_2013; @hubley_georges_2014]. **Information on stock status** was last published in 2001 for the SFA 25 Eastern Scotian Shelf stocks (Sable and Middle Banks) and in 1997 for SFA 26C German Bank. **Information related to stock status** on SFA 26B Browns Bank South, SFA 25B Banquereau Bank and SFA 27B Georges Bank 'b' has not been published before.

This document will review the available fishery and survey data for SFAs 25, 26 and 27B to support the development of reference points **within these management units**. Methods used to collect fishery-independent data (e.g. survey design and sampling protocols), and calculate survey indices and model inputs will be reviewed. Methodological changes will be proposed for the relationship between meat weight and shell height, the relationship between shell height and age, and the size of recruit and fully-recruited scallops. 


## Species biology

Sea scallop (_Placopecten magellanicus_) biology is summarized by Jonsen et al. (2009), Naidu and Robert (2006), and Stokesbury et al. (2016). Paraphrasing these summaries, sea scallops are bivalve molluscs that range from North Carolina, US to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. They are broadcast spawners, with pelagic larvae settling on the seafloor at depths of 18-110m after 1-2 months. While largely sessile, juveniles and adults may be able to swim short distances, adjust their orientation or position in the sediment, or attach to substrate with byssus threads. Growth rates are dependent on environmental conditions such as depth and temperature, likely due to the availability of microbial planktonic food sources. Sexual maturation is typical within 3-5 years of age (with shell heights of approximately 75-100 mm). Spawning occurs in the fall in most years, but also in the spring when conditions are adequate. Recent studies have contributed new information to the understanding of sea scallop spatial distribution (McDonald et al. 2021, 2022 and 2023), growth (Hart and Chute 2009, Hennen and Hart 2012, Pousse et al. 2023), swimming (Mason et al. 2014), spawning (Thompson et al. 2014), natural mortality (Hart and Cheng 2022, Siemann et al. 2019) and environmental influences on biology (Friedland et al. 2023, Liu et al. 2021).

# Fishery

The Maritimes Region Offshore Scallop fishery is described in an [Integrated Fisheries Management Plan](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fisheries-peches/ifmp-gmp/scallop-petoncle/2018/index-eng.html) (DFO 2022) that is updated as needed by DFO Resource Management. To summarize, there are six license-holding companies and currently ten active vessels. The fishery is managed using a total allowable catch (TAC) with Enterprise Allocations for each company based on a percent share of the TAC. In addition to following license conditions related to gear, vessel size, and meat count (the number of scallops in a 500 gram sample), each fishing trip must complete a fishing logbook and participate in dockside monitoring upon landing. These data are used to track landings against the TACs and for stock assessment purposes. 

TACs have varied over time, but are consistently highest in SFA 27A (not included here), followed by SFA 26A and 27B (Figure \@ref(fig:hist)). Fishing seasons run from January 1 to December 31 for all SFAs, except SFA 26C German Bank which runs from June 1 to November 15 to avoid gear conflicts with the lobster fishery (DFO 2022). Each SFA corresponds to a bathymetric bank, except SFA **25A**, which represents the Eastern Scotian Shelf and contains both Sable, **Western**, and Middle Banks. **The Western/Emerald Bank Conservation Area (WEBCA) was established in 2017, closing part of this management unit to scallop fishing.** Middle Bank is shown separately from Sable Bank in our fishery figures as the two banks are surveyed separately. 


## Fishery history

Historically, Georges Bank has been the primary focus of the offshore scallop fishery. In 1977, Canada and the US both declared 200-mile fishing zones. This limited Canadian vessels to fishing a disputed zone of Georges Bank. The dispute and the competitive fishery continued in this area until the International Court of Justice (ICJ) established an international boundary in October 1984, which awarded the Northeast portion of Georges Bank to Canada. The establishment of the ICJ line initiated discussions between DFO and industry on how to rebuild and maintain the offshore scallop stocks (for more details see Jonsen et al., 2009).  This led to opportunities and interest in the potential exploitation of other banks within the Canadian offshore jurisdiction.  In September 1986, the Minister divided the inshore and offshore scallop fleets with a separation at the 43°40’ North latitude line near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. This led to the inshore fleet being phased out of the Georges Bank, Browns Bank and German Bank fisheries over the next few years, while the offshore fleet was not permitted to fish in what were classified as inshore waters (Jonsen et al., 2009). These changes to the available fishing areas for the offshore fleet led to competition for access to fishing grounds and resulted in the exploitation of all known beds, even in areas quite distant from home ports (e.g. Banquereau) (Robert et al., 1988). As a result the coverage of the DFO survey expanded to cover the new fishing grounds.

Since 2010, the offshore scallop fleet has gradually shifted towards the use of factory freezer trawler vessels and automatic shucking machines. This has lead to divergence in catch rates between different vessel types that may reflect different fishing strategies. As of 2023, the majority of the fleet (8 out of 10 active vessels) are freezer trawlers. Further analysis is needed to understand the impact of these changes. 


## Fishery data

Commercial fishery data are subjected to a quality control process to validate information related to location, date, gear, tow duration and number, and landings. For historical consistency, for fishing that occurred prior to 2009, only data that passed historical quality control protocols (and were historically deemed "class 1") were used for catch rate calculation; however total effort and total catch includes all records. 

In SFA 25, scallop catch has been below 100 tonnes in recent years (Figure \@ref(fig:fts-25)). In SFA 25, landings have traditionally been highest from Sable Bank, however it was last fished in 2021. Fishing effort has been below 50 000 hour-metres in all SFA 25 management units since 2000, with catch rates (kilograms per hour-metre; **kg/hm**) below 10 in most years. Catch rates were above 10 kg/hm in SFA 25B Banquereau in some years, but this area was fished in fewer years overall. Fishing has occurred over much of Middle and Sable Bank since 1980, with landings highest in the western portion of Sable Bank, and southeast of Middle Bank (Figure \@ref(fig:foot-25)). Fishing on Banquereau has been targeted to small areas, possibly due to the discontinuous fishing activity over time (Figure \@ref(fig:foot-25)). **Meat weights** varied within and between management units in SFA 25 (Table \@ref(tab:ps-tab)). On Sable Bank, median annual meat weights only exceeded 20 grams in 2012 (Figure \@ref(fig:mw-annual)). **removed monthly**

In SFA 26, scallop catch varies between management units. SFA 26A Browns Bank north has been below 500 tonnes in recent years, but has exceeded 1000 tonnes historically, while SFA 26B Browns Bank south and 26C German Bank have been below 250 tonnes for many years (Figure \@ref(fig:fts-26)). Fishing on SFA 26B Browns Bank south is more sporadic than in the other two areas; for example the area was not fished from 2014-2016 or 2020-2021 (Figure \@ref(fig:fts-26)). Fishing effort has rarely exceeded 50 000 hour-metres in any of the SFA 26 management units, while catch rates (kilograms per hour-metre) have been variable (Figure \@ref(fig:fts-26)). Fishing has occurred throughout SFA 26 since 1980, but overall catches have been highest on SFA 26A Browns Bank north, particularly in the northern half of the management unit (Figure \@ref(fig:foot-26)). **Meat weights** varied within and between management units in SFA 26, with the long term median for SFA 26B Browns Bank south reaching **11.1, while the other two areas were approximately 17-19** (Table \@ref(tab:ps-tab)). On SFA 26A Browns Bank north, median annual meat weights only exceeded 20 grams in five years (Figure \@ref(fig:mw-annual)). **removed monthly**

In SFA 27B, annual scallop catch has generally been below 750 tonnes (Figure \@ref(fig:fts-27)). The area has been fished every year since 1981, except 2011. Fishing effort has rarely exceeded 30 000 hour-metres since 2002, while catch rates have increased to exceed 20 kilograms per hour-metre in recent years (Figure \@ref(fig:fts-27)). Fishing has occurred throughout SFA 27B since 1980, and catches are usually highest along the border with SFA27A (Figure \@ref(fig:foot-27)). Meat counts varied in SFA 27B, with a long term median of 36, which is above SFA 26A but below SFA 26B (Table \@ref(tab:ps-tab)). 


# Survey

The Offshore Scallop Survey occurs through Collaborative Agreements (formerly Joint Project Agreements) between DFO Science and the Seafood Producers Association of Nova Scotia (SPANS). The survey collects data Sea Scallop (*Placopecten magellanicus*) on the Scotian Shelf and the Canadian side of Georges Bank, as well as Iceland Scallop (*Chlamys islandica*) on Banquereau Bank. The **survey occurs in multiple subareas within** SFAs 25, 26, and 27, and the survey data are the primary source of fishery-independent information used in the Maritimes Region scallop stock assessments. Under the Collaborative Agreement, survey responsibilities are shared by DFO and SPANS. At-sea survey activities are directed by the DFO Chief Scientist aboard the survey vessel. SPANS coordinates the provision the survey vessel as well as the necessary crew complement to conduct the survey activities. DFO Science designs the survey, provides and manages scientific equipment, and validates, archives, and analyzes survey data. 

## Survey history  

**In 1979, the first official surveys of Browns Bank North (now SFA 26A, then simply Browns Bank) and German Bank (now SFA 26C) occurred. The surveys were funded by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and conducted on the CCGS E.E. Prince.** The station allocation methodology employed a stratified sampling design based on commercial catch rate (Robert and Jamieson, 1986), where catch rate strata for each bank were defined annually. The individual commercial catch rate strata for each of the offshore banks were customized to the specific catch levels encountered on the bank, and stations were randomly allocated within each strata.  

In 1983, Middle and Sable/Western Banks (SFA 25) were added to the survey. For the next decade, survey coverage depended on the levels of fishing activity/effort on the individual banks with occasional limited surveys of Banquereau Bank (SFA 25B).  The area surveyed on each bank (or “survey domain”) changed significantly during these years, leading to a lack of continuity in survey results (Robert et al., 1987). During this period, there were additional projects (not detailed here) included in the survey activities, including scallop tagging, phytoplankton and larval sampling, monitoring of juvenile hake within scallops, monitoring of epiphytes, genetic analysis, and meat sampling for heavy metal analysis. The evolving survey sampling designs are detailed by bank below. 

In 1994, the CCGS E.E. Prince was slated for retirement. Under the shared stewardship arrangement between the Offshore Scallop industry and DFO, the industry provided and crewed a commercial scallop fishing vessel, FV Cape Keltic, to conduct the annual stock assessment surveys of the offshore scallop banks under the direction of a DFO Biologist (DFO 2022). Comparative survey towing activities took place on Middle (12 tows), Sable (58 tows), Browns North (30 tows) and Georges Banks (12 tows) in 1994 and the survey vessel transition took place. Since this time there have been three additional vessel changes; no comparative surveys were undertaken for these vessel changes. In 2007 and 2008, the survey took place on the FV E.E. Pierce, from 2009-2014 the survey took place on the FV Tenacity and starting in 2015 the FV Fundy Leader has been used for the survey. 

In 2015, there were delays in survey vessel preparations and therefore survey operations.  Due to the delays, Middle and Sable/Western Banks were not surveyed. Browns Bank North was surveyed in July/August, with additional tows taking place in late September along with a German Bank survey in September.  

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a limited survey of Browns Bank North and the northern portion of Georges Bank was conducted by industry partners with logistical support from DFO Science but no DFO Science leadership on the vessel. These data were collected for informational purposes but were not included in stock assessment analysis since the approved survey design was not used. A selection of stations from the 2018 and 2019 surveys of these banks formed the survey design in 2020.


## Sampling protocols  

Regardless of survey design, the same sampling protocol is followed: At each survey station, a 2.44 m New Bedford style scallop dredge (75 mm ring size) lined with 38 mm polypropylene netting used to conduct tows at predetermined locations. Each survey tow occurs for 10 minutes at a speed of 3 to 4 knots. 

The scallop catch from each tow is sorted into baskets (for scallops > 50mm) and buckets (for scallops ≤ 50mm or less). The individual scallops' shell heights are measured to the nearest 5 millimeters and their mortality state (dead or alive) is recorded.

At the start of the survey time series, biological samples of 30 scallops were taken from a tow every 10 minute square of latitude and longitude.  The scallops were dissected into meat, gonad, and soft parts while on board the vessel. The individual components were then frozen while at sea. In a DFO lab onshore at a later date; the biological components were thawed, weighed (wet and dry weight), had their shell heights measured precisely (instead of using the 5 mm bins) and aged.  In Summer of 2010, the procedure was revised such that only meat weight and shell height information were collected, but for an increased number of scallops; this sampling process now takes place exclusively on the vessel during the survey. The relationship between the shell height and adductor muscle weight is particularly useful for monitoring the condition of scallops in a given place and time (Hubley et al., 2011).

Tows are tracked using a global positioning system (GPS) to provide information on location and length (Hubley et al. 2014). Tow lengths can vary due to conditions such as vessel speed, tides, and sea state. For this reason, accurate tow lengths are required to standardize shell height frequency data across tows of various lengths to a common 800m tow length. Over the past two of decades, Ocean Vision was the navigational system used to record tow tracks, but this program has become outdated.  

During the 2022 Offshore Scallop surveys of German Bank, Browns Bank North, and Georges Bank (a and b), the Olex navigational system was trialed as a replacement for Ocean Vision. A total of 449 tows were recorded using both systems. Tow tracking followed the same at-sea protocol as usual, but two systems were used simultaneously. Tow lengths were calculated based on the tracks recorded by each system and compared by tow using the sf package in R (find citations!). The tows were recorded using the WGS 84 coordinate reference system, but were converted to the appropriate UTM zone for the purposes of length calculation.  

Tows recorded using Olex were found to be longer in length (metres) than tows recorded using Ocean Vision (Figure \@ref(fig:nav-linear)). The median difference in length was 41.5m (or 4%). After standardizing all tows for an 800m tow length, this systematic difference would result in a small negative bias in indices derived from tows recorded using the Olex system compared to historical tows measured with Ocean Vision. To eliminate the bias in tow length (L_tow), a correction factor (φ) of 1.04 was applied to the Olex tow length (L_olex):

L_tow=L_olex/φ

This correction factor will be applied to all future Olex tows to ensure comparability with historical data collected under the Ocean Vision system (Figure \@ref(fig:nav-box)). Historical data collected using Ocean Vision will not be affected by the transition to Olex.

## Survey database

The Offshore Scallop assessment survey data (1978-Present) are housed in an internal DFO Oracle database called SCALOFF. As annual surveys take place, the data are validated and uploaded to the SCALOFF database. This allows for consistent data handling, quality control, and data security. Data stewardship responsibilities are held by DFO Science as part of the Collaborative Agreement.

## Survey design  

### SFA 25

#### Banquereau Bank (25B)

The first survey on Banquereau Bank was an extension of the survey that was taking place on Sable/Western Bank in 1985.  Over the next two decades there were a few years (1987, 1988, 1999) with limited surveys that employed a simple random sampling design that was informed by historical catch rates.  

In absence of new knowledge of scallop distribution, the 2006 survey repeated 15 of the 18 survey tows from 1999, plus an additional 3 exploratory tows.  The stations sampled in 2012 were random but informed by fishing effort distribution, these stations were repeated in 2019 with three additional exploratory stations. 

On Banquereau Bank, Sea scallops and Icelandic scallops both occur in harvestable quantities.  In 2006, 2012, and 2019, both Sea scallops and Icelandic scallops were measured and enumerated separately but with the same onboard procedures to provide abundance estimates for both scallop species (2019 stations are **shown** in Figure \@ref(fig:map-ban)). 

Currently, there is no plan to survey Banquereau Bank on an annual basis  (Table \@ref(tab:strata-tab)). 

#### Middle Bank (25A)

In 1983, Middle Bank was added to the offshore scallop survey plan due to fishing effort expanding on to the Eastern Scotian Shelf.  Survey coverage of the bank used a stratified design based on catch.  An example of how the catch stratification was implemented can be found using the 1984 data, in this year, Middle Bank (10.6 % total Scotian Shelf catch) was assigned two strata (>7% total catch, <7% total catch). High strata made up 60% of the total area to be surveyed, so 12 of the 20 stations were randomly allocated to high strata and 8 stations were randomly allocated to the low strata.  This design was used between 1984 and 1988 with the number of stations varying from 6 to 20.

There was no survey between 1989 and 1991 (Robert and Butler-Connolly 1991). In 1992,  there were 8 catch rate stratified tows (Robert and Butler 1993).  Due to low stock levels and minimal fishing activity the survey was cancelled in 1993 (Robert and Butler 1994).

In 1994, the survey was used to establish baseline data. Stratification for the 1994 survey using the 1993 catch would have provided poor coverage since fishing activity was very limited.  Additional tows were added to the survey (exploratory stratum) to cover areas fished in the past (Robert and Butler 1996).  The Middle Bank survey was also included in the comparative survey between the CCGS E.E. Prince and the industry supplied FV Cape Keltic.  From 1994-1996, the survey maintained this fixed station design with 12 stations.  In 1997, three additional fixed stations were added and this survey design has not changed since  (Table \@ref(tab:strata-tab), Figure \@ref(fig:map-mid)). 

#### Sable/Western Bank (25A)

In 1983, Sable/Western Bank was added to the survey plan due to the fishing effort expanding on to the Eastern Scotian Shelf. Survey coverage of the bank used a stratified design based on catch. Station locations were randomly assigned within the 10’ units with at least 5 fishing days according to a low, medium, and high strata defined by percentage of total catch for the area. The 1983 survey was cancelled due to weather conditions.

An example of how the catch stratification was implemented can be found using the 1984 data.  In this year, the Sable/Western Bank survey (18.6% total Scotian Shelf catch) assigned stations to High >8% total catch (45% of total area, 13 stations), Med 4-8% total catch (33% total area, 13 stations), and low 0-4% total catch (23% total area, 14 stations) stratum.   

By 1986, the new management regime for Georges Bank stocks (Enterprise Allocation, or EA) had changed the patterns of exploitation on the Scotian Shelf from opportunistic to quasi-permanent with catches from Sable/Western being the highest to date (Robert et al., 1987).  Due to these changes the Sable/Western survey area coverage expanded significantly from 1986 to 1990. There was a lack of continuity in the survey results due to the changes in the survey domain over this period (Robert et al. 1988 and Robert et al. 1990).

In 1991, the survey of the northern section of Western Bank was not completed due to ship crew overtime regulations; only 76 of the 90 planned stations were completed. The high stratum was completed as planned, the medium stratum was missing 2 tows, and only 50% of the planned tows in the low stratum were completed (Robert and Butler 1992). In 1994, the aforementioned comparative survey was also undertaken on Sable/Western Bank.  As with other areas, there were no significant differences in abundance(?) for scallop shell height classes over 100mm (Robert and Butler 1995).  Half of the survey stations in 1994 were selected to explore areas not presently fished to obtain base line data for these areas.  Stratification for the 1994 survey using the 1993 catch would have provided poor coverage since the geographical area of fishing activities was limited.  The stations conducted on Sable/Western Bank in 1994 were repeated in 1995 to provide a baseline of scallop abundance (Robert and Butler 1996).

In the next few years, additional tows were added to the survey (exploratory stratum) to cover grounds fished in the past on Sable/Western Bank.  From 1999-2009, the survey design was based on the catch rate stratification methodology and 135 stations were sampled each year. 
From 2010 onwards, the stratification has been based on the historical survey index  (Table \@ref(tab:strata-tab)). There was a reduction in survey stations in 2012 due to reduced fishing effort and area covered by the fleet.  The survey area (domain) was further reduced in 2018 to accommodate the Western/Emerald Banks Conservation Area (IFMP 2018). The most recent survey of Sable Bank is mapped in Figure \@ref(fig:map-sab). 

#### SFA 25 Overview

Spatial analysis shows the coverage and variability of survey tow locations in SFA 25 (Figure \@ref(fig:sfoot-25)). On Middle Bank, the number of survey tows in some 10km^2 cells is high because of the fixed survey design, whereas the stratification approach on Sable Bank leads to a broader and more even coverage.

### SFA 26

#### Browns Bank (26A/B)

The first opportunistic survey in 1978 consisted of 7 randomly selected stations in areas where the commercial fleet was active.  The following year, an official survey took place using randomly selected locations, allocated in units of 10 minutes of latitude and longitude and based on scallop fishing activity.  In 1981, the commercial fishing logs from September 1980 to June 1981 were used to determine areas (in 10 minute squares) with at least 10 days of fishing.  These data were then separated into 4 catch strata levels (low, med, high and exploratory), and stations were allocated randomly within these strata.  Some station locations were adjusted due to unsuitable substrate for towing.  Similar methodology was used in subsequent years with the catch strata levels and strata areas being refined annually to reflect the catch rates experienced during fishing activities.  The 1982 survey was cancelled due to weather.

An example of how the catch stratification was implemented can be found using the 1984 data. In this year, Browns Bank/Tusket (11.3% total Scotian Shelf catch) was assigned High >10% total catch (66% total area, 10 stations), Med 4-10% total catch (25% total area, 7 stations), and Low 0-4% total catch (8% total area, 3 stations). In 1985, an exploratory stratum was added to Browns Bank to allow survey stations to occur in an area that   was not fished in 1984, that had high numbers of age 2 scallops in previous surveys (Robert et al. 1986). In 1988 and 1989 the Browns Bank survey was cancelled due to a lack of fishing activity (Robert et al. 1989).

An experimental fishery and management plan was implemented in 1989 for Browns Bank. Exploitation increased substantially because there had been an accumulation of biomass due to lack of fishing activity and there was a perception that the bank could potentially sustain long-term continuous exploitation (Robert et al. 1990). The 1990 survey focused on the areas fished during the experimental fishery since there had been little fishing activity for several years before this.

In 1994, comparative surveys took place using the retiring CCGS E.E Prince and the industry supplied commercial scallop dragger, FV Cape Keltic to facilitate the change to a new survey vessel.  There were no significant differences between the two vessels for scallop shell height classes over 100mm (Robert and Butler 1995).  The catch distribution from the previous 9 months derived from log records was used to stratify survey stations which were randomized within low, medium and high strata.  A very high stratum was also added in 1994 to reduce the variability in the high stratum given the catch-rates observed.  In future years, an exploratory stratum was occasionally added to address any areas that warranted additional investigation (Robert and Butler 1997).

In the fall of 1994, an additional survey took place on the south side of Browns Bank.  The areas sampled were based on the locations fished between 1976 and 1985 and set in a grid pattern (Robert and Butler 1995).  This led to the expansion of the survey area in 1995 and 1996.  Areas previously fished accounted for 64% of the total survey area in these years (Robert and Butler 1997).

In the late 1990s, information from a multibeam bathymetric survey (Canadian Hydrographic Service and Atlantic Geological Survey of Canada) of a portion of Browns Bank became available and was used in planning survey tows and towing direction (Kostylev et al. 2001).  These mapping data provided higher resolution delineation of bottom type and topography.  The introduction of bottom mapping data lead to a re-evaluation of effort and catch-rate measurements used for the survey design (Robert and Butler 1998).

By 2001, the relationship between bottom type (surficial geology) and scallop abundance was better understood.  As a result, the stratification scheme for the survey was changed to a design based on surficial geology (Kostylev et al. 2001 and 2003). The survey stations were randomly selected and allocated proportionally to the area of the 5 surficial geology strata; the 5 strata were Gravel lag with thin sand, Gravel Lag, thin sand over gravel lag, thick sand, and sand with barchans.  Surficial geology strata were fixed from year to year between 2001 and 2012 (Tables 1 and 2). Additionally in 2001, Browns Bank was divided into North and South management areas and the areas were assigned separate surveys (Hubley et al. 2011).  

Since 2011, Browns Bank South has not been surveyed every year, but the intermittent surveys continue to use the surficial geology design for stratification. However, on Browns Bank north, over time it became evident that the surficial geology were unable to account for the spatial variability in scallop abundance (Hubley et al. 2013).  A 2013 science and industry working group recommended a change in design to fixed strata that were based on a more direct measure of scallop abundance.  The historical commercial catch rate (HCR) for 2002-2012 was chosen as a stratifying variable because of limited survey coverage in previous years.  This new design had significant gains in realized and potential efficiency (Hubley et al. 2013). The survey strata area were refined in 2021 and is the current design used for Browns Bank north, while surficial geology strata are still used for Browns Bank south (Table \@ref(tab:strata-tab), Figures \@ref(fig:map-bbs), \@ref(fig:map-bbn)).  

#### German Bank (26C)

In 1979, the first official survey on German Bank took place using a random station design allocated using a ten minute (10’) square grid and the amount of scallop fishing activity that took place.

In 1981, sampling locations were determined from commercial fishing activity from September 1980 to June 1981. Unit areas (10’) with 10 days of fishing were separated into four strata levels based on landings from the unit area.  Some station locations were adjusted due to unsuitable substrate for towing.  At the start of the survey series, German Bank was surveyed using the liner in the dredge but upon experiencing extensive damage to the liner due to the bathymetry of the area, it was decided to survey the area without a liner.  In 2009, after accumulating years of experience surveying German Bank, the addition of high resolution bathymetry maps, and completing a trial survey with lined tows in 2008, it was decided to return to surveying the area with a liner.

The 1982 survey was cancelled due to weather.  In 1983, station locations were randomly assigned within the 10’ units with 5 fishing days according to a low, medium, and high strata defined by percentage total catch for the area.  An example of how the catch stratification was implemented can be found using the 1984 data, in this year, German (59.5% total Scotian Shelf catch) was assigned High <10% total catch, Med 4-10% total catch and Low <4% total catch stratum.  From 1986 to 1993 German bank was not surveyed due to lack of fishing activity in the area (Robert and Butler-Connolly 1991).

In the Fall of 1994, survey operations resumed on German Bank after a 8 year hiatus (there was no fishing activity for 7 years). This survey took place using the industry supplied commercial scallop dragger, FV Cape Keltic.  This survey covered areas south of the 43°40’ line and occurred after the lobster season to avoid gear conflicts.  The restriction on the area surveyed was due to the inshore/offshore fleet separation that occurred in December of 1986 (Robert and Butler 1995).  The catch distribution derived from log records from the previous year was used to stratify survey stations; the stations were randomized within arbitrarily set strata. An exploratory stratum was occasionally added to the survey and the area surveyed depended on the location of the fishing activity in the previous year (Robert and Butler 1995, Robert and Butler 1997).

In 1997 and 1998 the German Bank survey was cancelled due to a lack of fishing activity.  Survey activities resumed in 1999 with the same catch stratification methodology.  Starting in 2003, a subset of the survey stations were repeated from the previous surveys, this was undertaken to better understand and improve the evaluation of the stock in this unique area. This continued until 2008. 

In 2008, a trial was conducted in which 30 of the 80 planned survey tows used a 38mm mesh polypropylene netting liner, and one exploratory tow that was conducted with a liner.  The results of this trial led to the use of lined gear from this point forward. In addition, from 2009 onwards the survey design was revamped to sampling with partial replacement design.  For this design, 25% of the stations are randomly selected from stations conducted in the previous year and 75% of the stations are randomly generated from areas with towable bottom (Table \@ref(tab:strata-tab), Figures \@ref(fig:map-ger)).

#### SFA 26 Overview

Spatial analysis shows the coverage and variability of survey tow locations in SFA 26 (Figure \@ref(fig:sfoot-26)). There have been more stations per 10km^2 cell on Browns Bank North than the other two areas due to the annual survey frequency and number of tows each year.

### SFA 27B

#### Georges Bank 'b' (27B)

Survey tows have been conducted on Georges Bank 'b' annually since 1978, **consistent with the Georges Bank survey description by Jonsen et al. (2009)**. The majority of the tows have occurred in August since the beginning of the time series, with some additional tows occurring in May or June in most years. Initially, the survey covered Georges Bank as a whole with 150 stations, using 4-6 strata based on annual commercial catch rate, so a variable number of tows occurred on Georges Bank 'b' each year. **In 2009, a stratification scheme was proposed for the August survey of Georges Bank 'a' based on the survey abundance index from 1981-2008, resulting in seven strata (Hubley et al. 2009)**. A similar approach was used for Georges Bank 'b', resulting in five strata that have been used since 2009 with 30 stations surveyed annually in August (Table \@ref(tab:strata-tab), Figure \@ref(fig:map-gbb)). **The spring monitoring survey of Georges Bank also includes 4 stations on Georges Bank 'b', but given the limited nature of this survey, these data are not presented here.** Over time, more tows have occurred near the boundary between Georges Bank 'a' and 'b' than along the slope of the bank (Figure \@ref(fig:sfoot-27)).

# Estimation methods

## Meat weight-shell height relationship

A meat weight-shell height (MWSH) model is used to extrapolate from the subset of detailed samples that are collected during each survey to the total survey catch, which when combined with abundance data, enables the estimation of biomass. 

Here, we evaluated various modelling approaches **using data from Sable Bank (part of SFA 25A) and Browns Bank North (SFA 26A)** and propose a model that is more flexible than the previous method, which assumes the classic height-weight relationship formulation **(where meat weight is the product of shell height cubed and a constant)**. This method is more intuitive while still achieving similar results to the previous method **as demonstrated by the diagnostics provided.**

First, we modelled the detailed sampling measurements. We fit a set of generalized linear mixed effect models with tow as an intercept-only random effect and shell height as a fixed effect. The set of models tested included combinations of including and excluding depth and year as fixed effects, as well as interactions between all explanatory variables. Shell height was log-transformed and centred at 100mm, while depth was centred at the median depth of measurements from each management unit. 

For both Sable Bank and Browns Bank North, the AIC model selection statistic suggested that allowing shell height and depth to vary by year is preferred over simpler models (Table \@ref(tab:mwsh-tab)). Residual patterns were deemed acceptable for the selected model for both management units (Figures \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-rs-1), \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-rs-2), \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-rs-3), \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-rm-1), \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-rm-2), \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-rm-3), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-rs-1), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-rs-2), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-rs-3), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-rm-1), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-rm-2),\@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-rm-3)). The effect of depth on the predictions also varied over time for both management units (Figures \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-depth), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-depth)).

Fitting the single model (as proposed above) did not converge, so the model was applied to the full survey dataset for each year independently (Figures \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-1), \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-2), \@ref(fig:mwsh-sab-3), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-1), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-2), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbn-3)). This annual modelling approach has been used in other scallop populations (INSHORE). This method also enables the estimation of uncertainty, which was not previously possible. Meat weight-shell height relationships for the other subareas were also developed using the proposed method (Figures \@ref(fig:mwsh-ban), \@ref(fig:mwsh-mid), \@ref(fig:mwsh-bbs), \@ref(fig:mwsh-ger), \@ref(fig:mwsh-gbb)).

## Fully-recruited size

Estimates of scallop age relative to shell height are used to understand growth rates. The stock assessment model uses a separate biomass estimate and growth rate for fully-recruited scallops (scallops that are landed by the fishery), and recruiting scallops (scallops that will be fully-recruited size in one year), thus there is a need to determine the minimum shell height of scallops landed by the fishery and the shell height of those scallops one year prior.

The proposed meat weight-shell height relationships were used to estimate the shell heights of fully-recruited scallop landed by the fishery, based on port sampled meat weights. The shell heights of meats landed on Sable Bank were estimated to range between 65 and 195 mm (Figure \@ref(fig:sh-ps-sab)). Less than 5% of meats landed year-round (Figure \@ref(fig:prop-ps-sab)) and during the peak spring-summer fishing season (Figure \@ref(fig:propss-ps-sab)) corresponded to shell heights below 90mm. On Browns Bank north, the shell heights of landed meats were also estimated to range between 65 and 195 mm (Figure \@ref(fig:sh-ps-bbn)). Less than 5% of meats landed year-round (Figure \@ref(fig:prop-ps-bbn)) and during the peak spring-summer fishing season (Figure \@ref(fig:propss-ps-bbn)) corresponded to shell heights below 90mm. As such, for SFA 25 and 26, we estimate the minimum shell height of fully-recruited scallop to be 90mm.


## Ageing

The relationship between shell height and age have historically been described using Von Bertalanffy growth models. In 2014, Von Bertalanffy parameters for Browns Bank north were determined to be L∞ = 148, K = 0.19, and t0 = 0.11 based on four aged scallop shells from 2012 (Hubley et al. 2014). Ageing of scallop shells from SFA 25 has not occurred previously. Hubley et al. (2014) attributed differences between their parameters and previous results to spatial variability in growth rates. 

For this framework, 95 shells from 19 different tows on Sable Bank in 2016 were aged, and 201 shells from 28 different tows on Browns Bank north in 2011 and 2012 were aged (Table \@ref(tab:age-summary)). Each increment between rings of shell growth was measured to the nearest millimetre, resulting in 383 and 804 measurements for Sable and Browns Bank north, respectively. As such, more measurements were available for increments of age 2-3 than those of older ages (and larger shell height), however measurements were obtained for ages up to 10 (Table \@ref(tab:age-inc)). For a given age increment, measurements from Browns Bank north were approximately 5-15mm larger than from Sable Bank (Table \@ref(tab:age-inc)). 

Von Bertalanffy growth models were developed using nonlinear least squares (NLS), with start values of L∞ = 150, K = 0.3 and t0 = 0. Generalized additive mixed models with 3 and 5 knots were also tested, but results were similar to the traditional NLS formulation, so the NLS models were selected to facilitate historical comparability and implementation. Confidence intervals (95%) were calculated using bootstrapping for the NLS models. 

For Sable Bank, the growth parameters based on increment measurements were L∞ = 159.2, K = 0.2, and t0 = 0.2  (Figure \@ref(fig:vb-sab)). The parameters based on entire shell measurements differed, but the curves were visually similar. For a scallop with a 90 mm shell height (minimum fully-recruited size), the model estimated an age of 4.46 years. We estimated the minimum shell height of recruit scallop to be the shell height one year prior, which was determined to be 74.96 mm ((Figure \@ref(fig:vb-sab)). Residuals of the proposed model were unbiased (Figure \@ref(fig:resid-sab)).  

For Browns Bank north, the growth parameters based on increment measurements were L∞ = 164.4, K = 0.2, and t0 = -0.2  (Figure \@ref(fig:vb-bbn)). The parameters based on entire shell measurements differed, but the curves were visually similar. For a scallop with a 90 mm shell height (minimum fully-recruited size), the model estimated an age of 3.81 years. We estimated the minimum shell height of recruit scallop to be the shell height one year prior, which was determined to be 73.66 mm ((Figure \@ref(fig:vb-bbn)). Residuals of the proposed model were unbiased (Figure \@ref(fig:resid-bbn)). 


## Recuit size range

Combining the estimates of minimum fully-recruited size derived from the port sampling data using the proposed meat weight-shell height model, and the estimates of minimum recruit size derived from the ageing estimates, we propose a recruit size range for SFA 25 and 26 of 75-90 mm. For evaluation purposes, recruit abundance and biomass estimates (per tow) were calculated using this proposed range, and comparable ranges. For SFA 25, the previously used range was 80-90 mm, and the alternate range chosen was 80-95 mm. The proposed range of 75-90 mm resulted in higher abundance and biomass estimates of recruits than would be estimated using the other options (Figure \@ref(fig:rec-comp-25)). For SFA 26A and 26B, the alternate ranges were 85-95 mm (the previously used range for Browns Bank north and south) and 80-95 mm. The previously used range for German Bank was 95-105 mm, and it is not recommended to adjust this range at this time. For SFA 26A and B, there was no clear pattern in the estimates of recruit abundance and biomass per tow from the proposed range of 75-90mm compared to the alternate size ranges (Figure \@ref(fig:rec-comp-26)).
