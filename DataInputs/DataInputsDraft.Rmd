# STOCK ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK FOR SCALLOP FISHING AREAS 25 AND 26: DATA INPUTS

## Context

Advice on the status of the Georges Bank Scallop stock is requested annually by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Resource Management to help determine an annual Total Allowable Catch (TAC, meat weight) in support of the fishery. The purpose of this report is to update the status of Georges Bank Scallop with data from the `r yr` Scallop survey and fishery (January 1 to December 31) to provide science advice for the management of the `r year` fishery. 

This Stock Status Update uses the assessment framework established in 2009 [@jonsen_georges_2009] and accepted during the peer-reviewed Regional Advisory Process of 2013 [@dfo_assessment_2013; @hubley_georges_2014]. Updates have been conducted annually since, with the exception of 2021, which did not occur because the 2020 DFO Science Offshore Scallop Survey was cancelled due to challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [dfo_stock_2022-1].

This update for the Scallop fishery on Georges Bank pertains to zone 'a'. Georges Bank zone 'b' has separate management measures. Some elements of the fishery in zone 'b' are also presented for continuity.

This Science Response reports results from the Science Response Process of April XX, `r year` on the Stock Status Update of Offshore Scallop: Browns Bank North and Georges Bank 'a'.
