```

Total allowable catch (TAC) levels (tonnes, black outlined bars), and catch (landings, tonnes, grey shading) from SFAs 25 (A), 26 (B) and 27B (C) by management unit. TACs were not used on the Eastern Scotian Shelf until 1995, however fishing was allowed. SFA 25A and 25B were treated as one management unit and SFA 26A and SFA 26B were treated as one management unit until 1998. Prior to 1998, fishing in SFA 27B was combined with fishing in SFA 27A (not shown).

Catch (commercial landings, tonnes, t), effort (hour-metre, hm), and catch per unit effort (kilograms per hour-metre, kg/hm) for SFA 25 management units. SFA 25A-Mid is shown in black with points, SFA 25A-Sab is shown in orange with triangles, and SFA 25B is shown in blue with squares. Vertical lines in the catch per unit effort panel (bottom) represent the 95% confidence interval using a jackknife estimator (Smith 1980).

Annual cumulative density of estimated shell heights of meats landed by the commercial fishery in SFA 25A-Mid collected during port sampling (black line), and of meats collected during the DFO Maritimes Offshore Scallop Survey (blue line), based on the new meat weight-shell height relationship derived from SFA 25A-Mid survey data. Shell heights are shown in 5 mm bins for consistency between the two datasets. Only meats landed from April to August (inclusive) are shown. Vertical dashed lines define the recruit size range.
