Map showing the offshore Scallop Fishing Areas (SFAs) used for management purposes in the Maritimes Region.

```

Total allowable catch (TAC) levels (tonnes, black outlined bars), and catch (landings, tonnes, grey shading) from SFAs 25 (A), 26 (B) and 27B (C) by management unit. TACs were not used on the Eastern Scotian Shelf until 1995, however fishing was allowed. SFA 25A and 25B were treated as one management unit and SFA 26A and SFA26B were treated as one management unit until 1998. Prior to 1998, fishing in SFA 27B was combined with fishing in SFA27A (not shown).

Catch (commercial landings, tonnes, t), effort (hour-metre, hm), and catch per unit effort (kilograms per hour-metre, kg/hm) for SFA 25 management units. SFA 25A Middle Bank is shown in black with points, SFA 25A Sable Bank is shown in orange with triangles, and SFA 25B Banquereau Bank is shown in blue with squares. Vertical lines in the catch per unit effort panel (bottom) represent the 95% confidence interval using a jackknife estimator (Smith 1980).

Ages and shell heights (in millimetres, mm) of scallops collected in SFA 25A Sable Bank in 2012 (black points), and the von Bertalanffy growth model based on incremental age analysis (black line). Model parameters are shown in text.  Grey shading represents the bootstrapped 95% confidence interval. The dashed red line shows the predicted age for a 90 mm shell height, while the green dashed line shows the predicted shell height (in mm) for scallops one year prior.
